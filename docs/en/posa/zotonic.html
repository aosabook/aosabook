          <h2 id="introduction-to-zotonic">Introduction to&nbsp;Zotonic</h2>

<p>Zotonic is an open source framework for doing full-stack web development, all the way from frontend to backend. Consisting of a small set of core functionalities, it implements a lightweight but extensible Content Management System on top. Zotonic’s main goal is to make it easy to create well-performing websites “out of the box”, so that a website scales well from the&nbsp;start.</p>

<p>While it shares many features and functionalities with web development frameworks like Django, Drupal, Ruby on Rails and Wordpress, its main competitive advantage is the language that Zotonic is powered by: Erlang. This language, originally developed for building phone switches, allows Zotonic to be fault tolerant and have great performance&nbsp;characteristics.</p>

<p>Like the title says, this chapter focusses on the performance of Zotonic. We’ll look at the reasons why Erlang was chosen as the programming platform, then inspect the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request stack, then dive in to the caching strategies that Zotonic employs. Finally, we&#8217;ll describe the optimisations we applied to Zotonic’s submodules and the&nbsp;database.</p>

<h2 id="why-zotonic-why-erlang">Why Zotonic? Why&nbsp;Erlang?</h2>

<p>The first work on Zotonic was started in 2008, and, like many projects, came from “scratching an itch”. Marc Worrell, the main Zotonic architect, had been working for seven years at Mediamatic Lab, in Amsterdam, on a Drupal-like <span class="caps">CMS</span> written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>/MySQL called Anymeta. Anymeta’s main paradigm was that it implemented a “pragmatic approach to the Semantic Web” by modeling everything in the system as generic “things”. Though successful, its implementations suffered from scalability&nbsp;problems.</p>

<p>After Marc left Mediamatic, he spent a few months designing a proper, Anymeta-like <span class="caps">CMS</span> from scratch. The main design goals for Zotonic were that it had to be easy to use for frontend developers; it had to support easy development of real-time web interfaces, simultaneously allowing long-lived connections and many short requests; and it had to have well-defined performance characteristics. More importantly, it had to solve the most common problems that limited performance in earlier Web development approaches&#8211;for example, it had to withstand the &#8220;Shashdot Effect&#8221; (a sudden rush of&nbsp;visitors).</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-the-classic-phpapache-approach">Problems with the Classic <span class="caps">PHP</span>+Apache&nbsp;Approach</h3>

<p>A classic <span class="caps">PHP</span> setup runs as a module inside a container web server like Apache. On each request, Apache decides how to handle the request. When it’s a <span class="caps">PHP</span> request, it spins up <code>mod_php5</code>, and then the <span class="caps">PHP</span> interpreter starts interpreting the script. This comes with startup latency: typically, such a spin-up already takes 5 ms, and then the <span class="caps">PHP</span> code still needs to run. This problem can partially be mitigated by using <span class="caps">PHP</span> accelerators which precompile the <span class="caps">PHP</span> script, bypassing the interpreter. The <span class="caps">PHP</span> startup overhead can also be mitigated by using a process manager like&nbsp;<span class="caps">PHP</span>-<span class="caps">FPM</span>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, systems like that still suffer from a <em>shared nothing</em> architecture. When a script needs a database connection, it needs to create one itself. Same goes any other I/O resource that could otherwise be shared between requests. Various modules feature persistent connections to overcome this, but there is no general solution to this problem in&nbsp;<span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>

<p>Handling long-lived client connections is also hard because such connections need a separate web server thread or process for every request. In the case of Apache and <span class="caps">PHP</span>-<span class="caps">FPM</span>, this does not scale with many concurrent long-lived&nbsp;connections.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-for-a-modern-web-framework">Requirements for a Modern Web&nbsp;Framework</h3>

<p>Modern web frameworks typically deal with three classes of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request. First, there are dynamically generated pages: dynamically served, usually generated by a template processor. Second, there is static content: small and large files which do not change (e.g., JavaScript, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and media assets). Third, there are long-lived connections: WebSockets and long-polling requests for adding interactivity and two-way communication to&nbsp;pages.</p>

<p>Before creating Zotonic, we were looking for a software framework and programming language that would allow us to meet our design goals (high performance, developer friendliness) and sidestep the bottlenecks associated with traditional web server systems. Ideally the software would meet the following&nbsp;requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Concurrent: it needs to support many concurrent connections that are not limited by the number of unix processes or <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;threads.</li>
<li>Shared resources: it needs to have a mechanism to share resources cheaply (e.g., caching, db connections) between&nbsp;requests.</li>
<li>Hot code upgrades: for ease of development and the enabling of hot-upgrading production systems (keeping downtime to a minimum), it would be nice if code changes could be deployed in a running system, without needing to restart&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Multi-core <span class="caps">CPU</span> support: a modern system needs to scale over multiple cores, as current CPUs tend to get scale in number of cores as opposed to increased clock&nbsp;speed.</li>
<li>Fault tolerant: the system needs to be able to handle exceptional situations, &#8220;badly behaving&#8221; code, anomalies or resource starvation. Ideally, the system would achieve this by having some kind of supervision mechanism to restart the failing&nbsp;parts.</li>
<li>Distributed: ideally, a system has built-in and easy to set up support for distribution over multiple nodes, to allow for better performance and protection against hardware&nbsp;failure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="erlang-to-the-rescue">Erlang to the&nbsp;Rescue</h3>

<p>To our knowledge, Erlang was the only language that met these requirements “out of the box”. The Erlang <span class="caps">VM</span>, combined with its Open Telecom Platform (<span class="caps">OTP</span>), provided the system that gave and continues to give us all the necessary&nbsp;features.</p>

<p>Erlang is a (mostly) functional programming language and runtime system. Erlang/<span class="caps">OTP</span> applications were originally developed for telephone switches, and are known for their fault-tolerance and their concurrent nature. Erlang employs an actor-based concurrency model: each actor is a lightweight “process” (green thread) and the only way to share state between processes is to pass messages. The Open Telecom Platform is the set of standard Erlang libraries which enable fault tolerance and process supervision, amongst&nbsp;others.</p>

<p>Fault tolerance is at the core of its programming paradigm: <em>let it crash</em> is the main philosophy of the system. As processes don’t share any state (to share state, they must send messages to each other), their state is isolated from other processes. As such, a single crashing process will never take down the system. When a process crashes, its supervisor process can decide to restart&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><em>Let it crash</em> also allows you to program for the happy case. Using pattern matching and function guards to assure a sane state means less error handling code is needed, which usually results in clean, concise, and readable&nbsp;code.</p>

<h2 id="zotonics-architecture">Zotonic’s&nbsp;Architecture</h2>

<p>Before we discuss Zotonic’s performance optimizations, let’s have a look at its architecture. <a href="#figure-9.1">Figure 9.1</a> describes Zotonic&#8217;s most important&nbsp;components.</p>

<div class="center figure">
<a name="figure-9.1"></a><img src="zotonic-images/zotonic-architecture.png" alt="Figure 9.1 - The architecture of Zotonic" title="Figure 9.1 - The architecture of Zotonic" />
</div>

<p class="center figcaption">
<small>Figure 9.1 - The architecture of Zotonic</small>
</p>

<p>The diagram shows the layers of Zotonic that an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request goes through. For discussing performance issues we’ll need to know what these layers are, and how they affect&nbsp;performance.</p>

<p>First, Zotonic comes with a built in web server, Mochiweb (another Erlang project). It does not require an external web server. This keeps the deployment dependencies to a minimum.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Like many web frameworks, a <span class="caps">URL</span> routing system is used to match requests to controllers. Controllers handle each request in a RESTful way, thanks to the Webmachine&nbsp;library.</p>

<p>Controllers are &#8220;dumb&#8221; on purpose, without much application-specific logic. Zotonic provides a number of standard controllers which, for the development of basic web applications, are often good enough. For instance, there is a <code>controller_template</code>, whose sole purpose it is to reply to <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">GET</span> requests by rendering a given&nbsp;template.</p>

<p>The template language is an Erlang-implementation of the well-known Django Template Language, called ErlyDTL. The general principle in Zotonic is that the templates drive the data requests. The templates decide which data they need, and retrieve it from the&nbsp;models.</p>

<p>Models expose functions to retrieve data from various data sources, like a database. Models expose an <span class="caps">API</span> to the templates, dictating how they can be used. The models are also responsible for caching their results in memory; they decide when and what is cached and for how long. When templates need data, they call a model as if it were a globally available&nbsp;variable.</p>

<p>A model is an Erlang wrapper module which is responsible for certain data. It contains the necessary functions to retrieve and store data in the way that the application needs. For instance, the central model of Zotonic is called <code>m.rsc</code>, which provide access to the generic resource (“page”) data model. Since resources use the database, <code>m_rsc.erl</code> uses a database connection to retrieve its data and pass it through to the template, caching it whenever it&nbsp;can.</p>

<p>This “templates drive the data” approach is different from other web frameworks like Rails and Django, which usually follow a more classical <span class="caps">MVC</span> approach where a controller assigns data to a template. Zotonic follows a less “controller-centric” approach, so that typical websites can be built by just writing&nbsp;templates.</p>

<!--TODO This used to reference the "Database Considerations" section, which was removed. -->

<p>Zotonic uses PostgreSQL for data persistence. <a href="#posa.zotonic.db">Data Model: a Document Database in <span class="caps">SQL</span></a> explains the rationale for this&nbsp;choice.</p>

<h3 id="additional-zotonic-concepts">Additional Zotonic&nbsp;Concepts</h3>

<p>While the main focus of this chapter are the performance characteristics of the web request stack, it is useful to know some of the other concepts that are at the heart of&nbsp;Zotonic.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Virtual&nbsp;hosting</dt>
<dd>A single Zotonic instance typically serves more than one site. It is designed for virtual hosting, including domain aliases and <span class="caps">SSL</span> support. And due to Erlang’s process-isolation, a crashing site does not affect any of the other sites running in the same&nbsp;<span class="caps">VM</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Modules</dt>
<dd>Modules are Zotonic’s way of grouping functionality together. Each module is in its own directory containing Erlang files, templates, assets, etc. They can be enabled on a per-site basis. Modules can hook into the admin system: for instance, the <code>mod_backup</code> module adds version control to the page editor and also runs a daily full database backup. Another module, <code>mod_github</code>, exposes a <code>webhook</code> which pulls, rebuilds and reloads a Zotonic site from github, allowing for continuous&nbsp;deployment.
</dd>
<dt>Notifications</dt>
<dd><p>To enable the loose coupling and extensibility of code, communication between modules and core components is done by a notification mechanism which functions either as a map or fold over the observers of a certain named notification. By listening to notifications it becomes easy for a module to override or augment certain behaviour. The calling function decides whether a map or fold is used. For instance, the <code>admin_menu</code> notification is a fold over the modules which allow modules to add or remove menu items in the admin&nbsp;menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Data&nbsp;model</dt>
<dd><p>The main data model that Zotonic uses can be compared to Drupal’s Node module; “every thing is a thing”. The data model consists of hierarchically categorized resources which connect to other resources using labelled edges. Like its source of inspiration, the Anymeta <span class="caps">CMS</span>, this data model is loosely based on the principles of the Semantic&nbsp;Web.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Zotonic is an extensible system, and all parts of the system add up when you consider performance. For instance, you might add a module that intercepts web requests, and does something on each request. Such a module might impact the performance of the entire system. In this chapter we’ll leave this out of consideration, and instead focus on the core performance&nbsp;issues.</p>

<h2 id="problem-solving-fighting-the-slashdot-effect">Problem Solving: Fighting the Slashdot&nbsp;Effect</h2>

<p>Most web sites live an unexceptional life in a small place somewhere on the web. That is, until one of their pages hit the front page of a popular website like <span class="caps">CNN</span>, <span class="caps">BBC</span> or Yahoo. In that case, the traffic to the website will likely increase to tens, hundreds, or even thousands of page requests per second in no&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Such a sudden surge overloads a traditional web server and makes it unreachable. The term &#8220;Slashdot Effect&#8221; was named after the web site that started this kind of overwhelming referrals. Even worse, an overloaded server is sometimes very hard to restart. As the newly started server has empty caches, no database connections, often un-compiled templates,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>Many anonymous visitors requesting exactly the same page around the same time shouldn’t be able to overload a server. This problem is easily solved using a caching proxy like Varnish, which caches a static copy of the page and only checks for updates to the page once in a&nbsp;while.</p>

<p>A surge of traffic becomes more challenging when serving dynamic pages for every single visitor; these can&#8217;t be cached. With Zotonic, we set out to solve this&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>We realized that most web sites&nbsp;have</p>

<ul>
<li>only have a limited number of very popular&nbsp;pages,</li>
<li>a long tail of far less popular pages,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>many shared parts on all pages (menu, most read items, news,&nbsp;etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>and decided&nbsp;to</p>

<ul>
<li>cache hot data in memory so no communication needed to access&nbsp;it,</li>
<li>share renderings of templates and sub-templates between requests and on pages on the web site,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>explicitly design the system to prevent overload on server start and&nbsp;restart.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cache-hot-data">Cache Hot&nbsp;Data</h3>

<p>Why fetch data from an external source (database, memcached) when another request fetched it already a couple of milliseconds ago? We always cache simple data requests. In the next section the caching mechanism is discussed in&nbsp;detail.</p>

<h3 id="share-rendered-templates-and-sub-templates-between-pages">Share Rendered Templates and Sub-templates Between&nbsp;Pages</h3>

<p>When rendering a page or included template, a developer can add optional caching directives. This caches the rendered result for a period of&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Caching starts what we called the <em>memo</em> functionality: while the template is being rendered and one or more processes request the same rendering, the later processes will be suspended. When the rendering is done all waiting processes will be sent the rendering&nbsp;result</p>

<p>The memoization alone&#8211;without any further caching&#8211;gives a large performance boost by drastically reducing the amount of parallel template&nbsp;processing.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-overload-on-server-start-or-restart">Prevent Overload on Server Start or&nbsp;Restart</h3>

<p>Zotonic introduces several bottlenecks on purpose. These bottlenecks limit the access to processes that use limited resources or are expensive (in terms of <span class="caps">CPU</span> or memory) to perform. Bottlenecks are currently set up for the template compiler, the image resizing process, and the database connection&nbsp;pool.</p>

<p>The bottlenecks are implemented by having a limited worker pool for performing the requested action. For <span class="caps">CPU</span> or disk intensive work, like image resizing, there is only a single process handling the requests. Requesting processes post their request in the Erlang request queue for the process and wait until their request is handled. If a request times out it will just crash. Such a crashing request will return <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status 503 <em>Service not available</em>.</p>

<p>Waiting processes don’t use many resources and the bottlenecks protect against overload if a template is changed or an image on a hot page is replaced and needs cropping or&nbsp;resizing.</p>

<p>In short: a busy server can still dynamically update its templates, content and images without getting overloaded. At the same time it allows single requests to crash while the system itself continues to&nbsp;operate.</p>

<h3 id="the-database-connection-pool">The Database Connection&nbsp;Pool</h3>

<p>One more word on database connections. In Zotonic a process fetches a database connection from a pool of connections for every single query or transaction. This enables many concurrent processes to share a very limited number of database connections. Compare this with most (<span class="caps">PHP</span>) systems where every request holds a connection to the database for the duration of the complete&nbsp;request.</p>

<p>Zotonic closes unused database connections after a time of inactivity. One connection is always left open so that the system can always handle an incoming request or background activity quickly. The dynamic connection pool drastically reduces the number of open database connections on most Zotonic web sites to one or&nbsp;two.</p>

<h2 id="caching-layers">Caching&nbsp;Layers</h2>

<p>The hardest part of caching is cache invalidation: keeping the cached data fresh and purging stale data. Zotonic uses a central caching mechanism with dependency checks to solve this&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>This section describes Zotonic’s caching mechanism in a top-down fashion: from the browser down through the stack to the&nbsp;database.</p>

<h3 id="client-side-caching">Client-Side&nbsp;Caching</h3>

<p>The client-side caching is done by the browser. The browser caches images, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files. Zotonic does not allow client-side caching of <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages, it always dynamically generates all pages. Because it is very efficient in doing so (as described in the previous section) and not caching <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages prevents showing old pages after users log in, log out, or comments are&nbsp;placed.</p>

<p>Zotonic improves client-side performance in two&nbsp;ways:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It allows caching of static files (<span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript, images&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li>It includes multiple <span class="caps">CSS</span> or JavaScript files in a single&nbsp;response</li>
</ol>

<p>The first is done by adding the appropriate <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers to the request<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Dec 2012 20:32:56 GMT
Expires: Sun, 01 Jan 2023 14:55:37 GMT
Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2013 14:55:37 GMT
Cache-Control: public, max-age=315360000</code></pre>

<p>Multiple <span class="caps">CSS</span> or JavaScript files are concatenated into a single file, separating individual files by a tilde and only mentioning paths if they change between&nbsp;files:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.org/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap
  ~bootstrap-responsive~bootstrap-base-site~
  /css/jquery.loadmask~z.growl~z.modal~site~63523081976.css</code></pre>

<p>The number at the end is a timestamp of the newest file in the list. The necessary <span class="caps">CSS</span> link or JavaScript script tag is generated using the <code>{% lib %}</code> template&nbsp;tag.</p>

<h3 id="server-side-caching">Server-Side&nbsp;Caching</h3>

<p>Zotonic is a large system, and many parts in it do caching in some way. The sections below explain some of the more interesting&nbsp;parts.</p>

<h3 id="static-css-js-and-image-files">Static <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">JS</span> and Image&nbsp;Files</h3>

<p>The controller handling the static files has some optimizations for handling these files. It can decompose combined file requests into a list of individual&nbsp;files.</p>

<p>The controller has checks for the <code>If-Modified-Since</code> header, serving the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status 304 <em>Not Modified</em> when&nbsp;appropriate.</p>

<p>On the first request it will concatenate the contents of all the static files into one byte array (an Erlang <em>binary</em>).<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> This byte array is then cached in the central depcache (see <a href="#posa.zotonic.depcache">Depcache</a>) in two forms: compressed (with gzip) and uncompressed. Depending on the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> headers sent by the browser, Zotonic will serve either the compressed or uncompressed&nbsp;version.</p>

<p>This caching mechanism is efficient enough that its performance is similar to many caching proxies, while still fully controlled by the web server. With an earlier version of Zotonic and on simple hardware (quad core 2.4 GHz Xeon from 2008) we saw throughputs of around 6000 requests/second and were able to saturate a gigabit ethernet connection requesting a small (~20 <span class="caps">KB</span>) image&nbsp;file.</p>

<h3 id="rendered-templates">Rendered&nbsp;Templates</h3>

<p>Templates are compiled into Erlang modules, after which the byte code is kept in memory. Compiled templates are called as regular Erlang&nbsp;functions.</p>

<p>The template system detects any changes to templates and will recompile the template during runtime. When compilation is finished Erlang’s hot code upgrade mechanism is used to load the newly compiled Erlang&nbsp;module.</p>

<p>The main page and template controllers have options to cache the template rendering result. Caching can also be enabled only for anonymous (not logged in) visitors. As for most websites, anonymous visitors generate the bulk of all requests and those pages will be not be personalized and (almost) be identical. Note that template rendering results is an intermediate result and not the final <span class="caps">HTML</span>. This intermediate result contains (among others) untranslated strings and JavaScript fragments. The final <span class="caps">HTML</span> is generated by parsing this intermediate structure, picking the correct translations and collecting all&nbsp;javascript.</p>

<p>The concatenated JavaScript, along with a unique page <span class="caps">ID</span>, is placed at the position of the <code>{% script %}</code> template tag. This should be just above the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> body tag. The unique page <span class="caps">ID</span> is used to match this rendered page with the handling Erlang processes and for WebSocket/Comet interaction on the&nbsp;page.</p>

<p>Like with any template language, templates can include other templates. In Zotonic, included templates are usually compiled inline to eliminate any performance lost by using included&nbsp;files.</p>

<p>Special options can force runtime inclusion. One of those options is caching. Caching can be enabled for anonymous visitors only, a caching period can be set, and cache dependencies can be added. These cache dependencies are used to invalidate the cached rendering if any of the shown resources is&nbsp;changed.</p>

<p>Another method to cache parts of templates is to use the <code>{% cache %} ... {% endcache %}</code> block tag, which caches a part of a template for a given amount of time. This tag has the same caching options as the include tag, but has the advantage that it can easily be added in existing&nbsp;templates.</p>

<h3 id="in-memory-caching">In-Memory&nbsp;Caching</h3>

<p>All caching is done in memory, in the Erlang <span class="caps">VM</span> itself. No communication between computers or operating system processes is needed to access the cached data. This greatly simplifies and optimizes the use of the cached&nbsp;data.</p>

<p>As a comparison, accessing a memcache server typically takes 0.5 milliseconds. In contrast, accessing main memory within the same process takes 1 nanoseconds on a <span class="caps">CPU</span> cache hit and 100 nanoseconds on a <span class="caps">CPU</span> cache miss&#8211;not to mention the huge speed difference between memory and network.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Zotonic has two in-memory caching mechanisms:<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Depcache, the central per-site&nbsp;cache</li>
<li>Process Dictionary Memo&nbsp;Cache</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="depcache">Depcache</h3>

<p><a name="posa.zotonic.depcache"> </a></p>

<p>The central caching mechanism in every Zotonic site is the <em>depcache</em>, which is short for <em>dep</em>endency <em>cache</em>. The depcache is an in-memory key-value store with a list of dependencies for every stored&nbsp;key.</p>

<p>For every key in the depcache we&nbsp;store:</p>

<ul>
<li>the key’s&nbsp;value;</li>
<li>a serial number, a global integer incremented with every update&nbsp;request;</li>
<li>the key’s expiration time (counted in&nbsp;seconds);</li>
<li>a list of other keys that this key depends on (e.g., a resource <span class="caps">ID</span> displayed in a cached template);&nbsp;and</li>
<li>if the key is still being calculated, a list of processes waiting for the key’s&nbsp;value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a key is requested then the cache checks if the key is present, not expired, and if the serial numbers of all the dependency keys are lower than serial number of the cached key. If the key was still valid its value is returned, otherwise the key and its value is removed from the cache and <code>undefined</code> is&nbsp;returned.</p>

<p>Alternatively if the key was being calculated then the requesting process would be added to the waiting list of the&nbsp;key.</p>

<p>The implementation makes use of <span class="caps">ETS</span>, the Erlang Term Storage, a standard hash table implementation which is part of the Erlang <span class="caps">OTP</span> distribution. The following <span class="caps">ETS</span> tables are created by Zotonic for the&nbsp;depcache:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meta table: the <span class="caps">ETS</span> table holding all stored keys, the expiration and the depending keys. A record in this table is written as <code>#meta{key, expire, serial, deps}</code>.</li>
<li>Deps table: the <span class="caps">ETS</span> table stores the serial for each&nbsp;key.</li>
<li>Data table: the <span class="caps">ETS</span> table that stores each key&#8217;s&nbsp;data.</li>
<li>Waiting PIDs dictionary: the <span class="caps">ETS</span> table that stores the IDs of all processes waiting for the arrival of a key’s&nbsp;value.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="caps">ETS</span> tables are optimized for parallel reads and usually directly accessed by the calling process. This prevents any communication between the calling process and the depcache&nbsp;process.</p>

<p>The depcache process is called&nbsp;for:</p>

<ul>
<li>memoization where processes wait for another process’s value to be&nbsp;calculated;</li>
<li><em>put</em> (store) requests, serializing the serial number increments;&nbsp;and</li>
<li>delete requests, also serializing the depcache&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The depcache can get quite large. To prevent it from growing too large there is a garbage collector process. The garbage collector slowly iterates over the complete depcache, evicting expired or invalidated keys. If the depcache size is above a certain threshold (100 MiB by default) then the garbage collector speeds up and evicts 10% of all encountered items. It keeps evicting until the cache is below its threshold&nbsp;size.</p>

<p>100 MiB might sound small in this area of multi-<span class="caps">TB</span> databases. However, as the cache mostly contains textual data it will be big enough to contain the hot data for most web sites. Otherwise the size of the cache can be changed in&nbsp;configuration.</p>

<h3 id="process-dictionary-memo-cache">Process Dictionary Memo&nbsp;Cache</h3>

<p>The other memory-caching paradigm in Zotonic is the process dictionary memo cache. As described earlier, the data access patterns are dictated by the templates. The caching system uses simple heuristics to optimize access to&nbsp;data.</p>

<p>Important in this optimization is data caching in the Erlang process dictionary of the process handling the request. The process dictionary is a simple key-value store in the same heap as the process. Basically, it adds state to the functional Erlang language. Use of the process dictionary is usually frowned upon for this reason, but for in-process caching it is&nbsp;useful.</p>

<p>When a resource is accessed (remember, a resource is the central data unit of Zotonic), it is copied into the process dictionary. The same is done for computational results&#8211;like access control checks&#8211;and other data like configuration&nbsp;values.</p>

<p>Every property of a resource&#8211;like its title, summary or body text&#8211;must, when shown on a page, perform an access control check and then fetch the requested property from the resource. Caching all the resource’s properties and its access checks greatly speeds up resource data usage and removes many drawbacks of the hard-to-predict data access patterns by&nbsp;templates.</p>

<p>As a page or process can use a lot of data this memo cache has a couple of pressure&nbsp;valves:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When holding more than 10,000 keys the whole process dictionary is flushed. This prevents process dictionaries holding many unused items, like what happens when looping through long lists of resources. Special Erlang variables like <code>$ancestors</code> are&nbsp;kept.</li>
<li>The memo cache must be programmatically enabled. This is automatically done for every incoming <span class="caps">HTTP</span> or WebSocket request and template&nbsp;rendering.</li>
<li>Between <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/WebSocket requests the process dictionary is flushed, as multiple sequential <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/WebSocket requests share the same&nbsp;process.</li>
<li>The memo cache doesn’t track dependencies. Any depcache deletion will also flush the complete process dictionary of the process performing the&nbsp;deletion.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the memo cache is disabled then every lookup is handled by the depcache. This results in a call to the depcache process and data copying between the depcache and the requesting&nbsp;process.</p>

<h2 id="the-erlang-virtual-machine">The Erlang Virtual&nbsp;Machine</h2>

<p>The Erlang Virtual Machine has a few properties that are important when looking at&nbsp;performance.</p>

<h3 id="processes-are-cheap">Processes are&nbsp;Cheap</h3>

<p>The Erlang <span class="caps">VM</span> is specifically designed to do many things in parallel, and as such has its own implementation of multiprocessing within the <span class="caps">VM</span>. Erlang processes are scheduled on a reduction count basis, where one reduction is roughly equivalent to a function call. A process is allowed to run until it pauses to wait for input (a message from some other process) or until it has executed a fixed number of reductions. For each <span class="caps">CPU</span> core, a scheduler is started with its own run queue. It is not uncommon for Erlang applications to have thousands to millions of processes alive in the <span class="caps">VM</span> at any given point in&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Processes are not only cheap to start but also cheap in memory at 327 words per process, which amounts to ~2.5 KiB on a 64 bit machine.<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> This compares to ~500 KiB for Java and a default of 2 MiB for&nbsp;pthreads.</p>

<p>Since processes are so cheap to use, any processing that is not needed for a request’s result is spawned off into a separate process. Sending an email or logging are both examples of tasks that could be handled by separate&nbsp;processes.</p>

<h3 id="data-copying-is-expensive">Data Copying is&nbsp;Expensive</h3>

<p>In the Erlang <span class="caps">VM</span> messages between processes are relatively expensive, as the message is copied in the process. This copying is needed due to Erlang’s per-process garbage collector. Preventing data copying is important; which is why Zotonic’s depcache uses <span class="caps">ETS</span> tables, which can be accessed from any&nbsp;process.</p>

<h4 id="separate-heap-for-bigger-byte-arrays">Separate Heap for Bigger Byte&nbsp;Arrays</h4>

<p>There is a big exception for copying data between processes. Byte arrays larger than 64 bytes are not copied between processes. They have their own heap and are separately garbage&nbsp;collected.</p>

<p>This makes it cheap to send a big byte array between processes, as only a reference to the byte array is copied. However, it does make garbage collection harder, as all references must be garbage collected before the byte array can be&nbsp;freed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, references to parts of a big byte array are passed: the bigger byte array can’t be garbage collected until the reference to the smaller part is garbage collected. A consequence is that copying a byte array is an optimization if that frees up the bigger byte&nbsp;array.</p>

<h3 id="string-processing-is-expensive">String Processing is&nbsp;Expensive</h3>

<p>String processing in any functional language can be expensive because strings are often represented as linked lists of integers, and, due to the functional nature of Erlang, data cannot be destructively&nbsp;updated.</p>

<p>If a string is represented as a list, then it is processed using tail recursive functions and pattern matching. This makes it a natural fit for functional languages. The problem is that the data representation of a linked list has a big overhead and that messaging a list to another process always involves copying the full data structure. This makes a list a non-optimal choice for&nbsp;strings.</p>

<p>Erlang has its own middle-of-the-road answer to strings: io-lists. Io-lists are nested lists containing lists, integers (single byte value), byte arrays and references to parts of other byte arrays. Io-lists are extremely easy to use and appending, prefixing or inserting data is inexpensive, as they only need changes to relatively short lists, without any data copying.<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>An io-list can be sent as-is to a “port” (a file descriptor), which flattens the data structure to a byte stream and sends it to a&nbsp;socket.</p>

<p>Example of an&nbsp;io-list:</p>

<pre><code> [ &lt;&lt;&quot;Hello&quot;&gt;&gt;, 32, [ &lt;&lt;&quot;Wo&quot;&gt;&gt;, [114, 108], &lt;&lt;&quot;d&quot;&gt;&gt;].</code></pre>

<p>Which flattens to the byte&nbsp;array:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;&lt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&gt;&gt;.</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly, most string processing in a web application consists&nbsp;of:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Concatenating data (dynamic and static) into the resulting&nbsp;page.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML</span> escaping and sanitizing content&nbsp;values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Erlang’s io-list is the perfect data structure for the first use case. And the second use case is resolved by an aggressive sanitization of all content <em>before</em> it is stored in the&nbsp;database.</p>

<p>These two combined means that for Zotonic a rendered page is just a big concatenation of byte arrays and pre-sanitized values in a single&nbsp;io-list.</p>

<h3 id="implications-for-zotonic">Implications for&nbsp;Zotonic</h3>

<p>Zotonic makes heavy use of a relatively big data structure, the <em>Context</em>. This is a record containing all data needed for a request evaluation. It&nbsp;contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>The request data: headers, request arguments, body data&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Webmachine&nbsp;status</li>
<li>User information (e.g., user <span class="caps">ID</span>, access control&nbsp;information)</li>
<li>Language&nbsp;preference</li>
<li><code>User-Agent</code> class (e.g., text, phone, tablet,&nbsp;desktop)</li>
<li>References to special site processes (e.g., notifier, depcache,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li>Unique <span class="caps">ID</span> for the request being processed (this will become the page&nbsp;<span class="caps">ID</span>)</li>
<li>Session and page process&nbsp;IDs</li>
<li>Database connection process during a&nbsp;transaction</li>
<li>Accumulators for reply data (e.g., data, actions to be rendered, JavaScript&nbsp;files)</li>
</ul>

<p>All this data can make a large data structure. Sending this large Context to different processes working on the request would result in a substantial data copying&nbsp;overhead.</p>

<p>That is why we try to do most of the request processing in a single process: the Mochiweb process that accepted the request. Additional modules and extensions are called using function calls instead of using inter-process&nbsp;messages.</p>

<p>Sometimes an extension is implemented using a separate process. In that case the extension provides a function accepting the Context and the process <span class="caps">ID</span> of the extension process. This interface function is then responsible of efficiently messaging the extension&nbsp;process.</p>

<p>Zotonic also needs to send a message when rendering cacheable sub-templates. In this case the Context is pruned of all intermediate template results and some other unneeded data (like logging information) before the Context is messaged to the process rendering the&nbsp;sub-template.</p>

<p>We don’t care too much about messaging byte arrays as they are, in most cases, larger than 64 bytes and as such will not be copied between&nbsp;processes.</p>

<p>For serving large static files, there is the option of using the Linux <code>sendfile()</code> system call to delegate sending the file to the operating&nbsp;system.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-the-webmachine-library">Changes to the Webmachine&nbsp;Library</h2>

<p>Webmachine is a library implementing an abstraction of the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol. It is implemented on top of the Mochiweb library which implements the lower level <span class="caps">HTTP</span> handling, like acceptor processes, header parsing,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>Controllers are made by creating Erlang modules implementing callback functions. Examples of callback functions are <code>resource_exists</code>, <code>previously_existed</code>, <code>authorized</code>, <code>allowed_methods</code>, <code>process_post</code>, etc. Webmachine also matches request paths against a list of dispatch rules; assigning request arguments and selecting the correct controller for handling the <span class="caps">HTTP</span>&nbsp;request.</p>

<p>With Webmachine, handling the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol becomes easy. We decided early on to build Zotonic on top of Webmachine for this&nbsp;reason.</p>

<p>While building Zotonic a couple of problems with Webmachine were&nbsp;encountered.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When we started, it supported only a single list of dispatch rules; not a list of rules per host (i.e.,&nbsp;site).</li>
<li>Dispatch rules are set in the application environment, and copied to the request process when&nbsp;dispatching.</li>
<li>Some callback functions (like <code>last_modified</code>) are called multiple times during request&nbsp;evaluation.</li>
<li>When Webmachine crashes during request evaluation no log entry is made by the request&nbsp;logger.</li>
<li>No support for <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Upgrade, making WebSockets support&nbsp;harder.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first problem (no partitioning of dispatch rules) is only a nuisance. It makes the list of dispatch rules less intuitive and more difficult to&nbsp;interpret.</p>

<p>The second problem (copying the dispatch list for every request) turned out to be a show stopper for Zotonic. The lists could become so large that copying it could take the majority of time needed to handle a&nbsp;request.</p>

<p>The third problem (multiple calls to the same functions) forced controller writers to implement their own caching mechanisms, which is error&nbsp;prone.</p>

<p>The fourth problem (no log on crash) makes it harder to see problems when in&nbsp;production.</p>

<p>The fifth problem (no <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Upgrade) prevents us from using the nice abstractions available in Webmachine for WebSocket&nbsp;connections.</p>

<p>The above problems were so serious that we had to modify Webmachine for our own&nbsp;purposes.</p>

<p>First a new option was added: dispatcher. A dispatcher is a module implementing the <code>dispatch/3</code> function which matches a request to a dispatch list. The dispatcher also selects the correct site (virtual host) using the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <code>Host</code> header. When testing a simple “hello world” controller, these changes gave a threefold increase of throughput. We also observed that the gain was much higher on systems with many virtual hosts and dispatch&nbsp;rules.</p>

<p>Webmachine maintains two data structures, one for the request data and one for the internal request processing state. These data structures were referring to each other and actually were almost always used in tandem, so we combined them in a single data structure. Which made it easier to remove the use of the process dictionary and add the new single data structure as an argument to all functions inside Webmachine. This resulted in 20% less processing time per&nbsp;request.</p>

<p>We optimized Webmachine in many other ways that we will not describe in detail here, but the most important points&nbsp;are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Return values of some controller callbacks are cached (<code>charsets_provided</code>, <code>content_types_provided</code>, <code>encodings_provided</code>, <code>last_modified</code>, and <code>generate_etag</code>).</li>
<li>More process dictionary use was removed (/less global state, clearer code, easier&nbsp;testing).</li>
<li>Separate logger process per request; even when a request crashes we have a log up to the point of the&nbsp;crash.</li>
<li>An <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Upgrade callback was added as a step after the <em>forbidden</em> access check to support&nbsp;WebSockets.</li>
<li>Originally, a controller was called a “resource”. We changed it to “controller” to make a clear distinction between the (data-)resources being served and the code serving those&nbsp;resources.</li>
<li>Some instrumentation was added to measure request speed and&nbsp;size.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-model-a-document-database-in-sql">Data Model: a Document Database in&nbsp;<span class="caps">SQL</span></h2>

<p><a name="posa.zotonic.db"> </a></p>

<p>From a data perspective it is worth mentioning that all properties of a “resource” (Zotonic’s main data unit) are serialized into a binary blob; “real” database columns are only used for keys, querying and foreign key&nbsp;constraints.</p>

<p>Separate “pivot” fields and tables are added for properties, or combinations of properties that need indexing, like full text columns, date properties,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>When a resource is updated, a database trigger adds the resource’s <span class="caps">ID</span> to the pivot queue. This pivot queue is consumed by a separate Erlang background process which indexes batches of resources at a time in a single&nbsp;transaction.</p>

<p>Choosing <span class="caps">SQL</span> made it possible for us to hit the ground running: PostgreSQL has a well known query language, great stability, known performance, excellent tools, and both commercial and non-commercial&nbsp;support.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the database is not the limiting performance factor in Zotonic. If a query becomes the bottleneck, then it is the task of the developer to optimize that particular query using the database’s query&nbsp;analyzer.</p>

<p>Finally, the golden performance rule for working with any database is: Don’t hit the database; don’t hit the disk; don’t hit the network; hit your&nbsp;cache.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks-statistics-and-optimizations">Benchmarks, Statistics and&nbsp;Optimizations</h2>

<p>We don’t believe too much in benchmarks as they often test only minimal parts of a system and don’t represent the performance of the whole system. Especially as a system has many moving parts and in Zotonic the caching system and handling common access patterns are an integral part of the&nbsp;design.</p>

<h3 id="a-simplified-benchmark">A Simplified&nbsp;Benchmark</h3>

<p>What a benchmark <em>might do</em> is show where you could optimize the system&nbsp;first.</p>

<p>With this in mind we benchmarked Zotonic using the TechEmpower <span class="caps">JSON</span> benchmark, which is basically testing the request dispatcher, <span class="caps">JSON</span> encoder, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request handling and the <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span>&nbsp;stack.</p>

<p>The benchmark was performed on a Intel i7 quad core M620 @ 2.67 GHz. The command was <code>wrk -c 3000 -t 3000 http://localhost:8080/json</code>. The results are shown in Table&nbsp;9.1.</p>

<p>Zotonic’s dynamic dispatcher and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol abstraction gives lower scores in such a micro benchmark. Those are relatively easy to solve, and the solutions were already&nbsp;planned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace the standard webmachine logger with a more efficient&nbsp;one</li>
<li>Compile the dispatch rules in an Erlang module (instead of a single process interpreting the dispatch rule&nbsp;list)</li>
<li>Replace the MochiWeb <span class="caps">HTTP</span> handler with the Elli <span class="caps">HTTP</span>&nbsp;handler</li>
<li>Use byte arrays in Webmachine instead of the current character&nbsp;lists</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="real-life-performance">Real-Life&nbsp;Performance</h3>

<p>For the 2013 abdication of the Dutch queen and subsequent inauguration of the new Dutch king a national voting site was built using Zotonic. The client requested 100% availability and high performance, being able to handle 100,000 votes per&nbsp;hour.</p>

<p>The solution was a system with four virtual servers, each with 2 <span class="caps">GB</span> <span class="caps">RAM</span> and running their own independent Zotonic system. Three nodes handled voting, one node was for administration. All nodes were independent but the voting nodes shared every vote with the at least two other nodes, so no vote would be lost if a node&nbsp;crashed.</p>

<p>A single vote gave ~30 <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests for dynamic <span class="caps">HTML</span> (in multiple languages), Ajax, and static assets like css and javascript. Multiple requests were needed for selecting the three projects to vote on and filling in the details of the&nbsp;voter.</p>

<p>When tested we easily met the customer’s requirements without pushing the system to the max. The voting simulation was stopped at 500,000 complete voting procedures per hour, using bandwidth of around 400 mbps, and 99% of request handling times were below 200&nbsp;milliseconds.</p>

<p>From the above it is clear that Zotonic can handle popular dynamic web sites. On real hardware we have observed much higher performance, especially for the underlying I/O and database&nbsp;performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When building a content management system or framework it is important to take the full stack of your application into consideration, from the web server, the request handling system, the caching systems, down to the database system. All parts must work well together for good&nbsp;performance.</p>

<p>Much performance can be gained by preprocessing data. An example of preprocessing is pre-escaping and sanitizing data before storing it into the&nbsp;database.</p>

<p>Caching hot data is a good strategy for web sites with a clear set of popular pages followed by a long tail of less popular pages. Placing this cache in the same memory space as the request handling code gives a clear edge over using separate caching servers, both in speed and&nbsp;simplicity.</p>

<p>Another optimization for handling sudden bursts in popularity is to dynamically match similar requests and process them once for the same result. When this is well implemented, a proxy can be avoided and all <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages generated&nbsp;dynamically.</p>

<p>Erlang is a great match for building dynamic web based systems due to its lightweight multiprocessing, failure handling, and memory&nbsp;management.</p>

<p>Using Erlang, Zotonic makes it possible to build a very competent and well-performing content management system and framework without needing separate web servers, caching proxies, memcache servers, or e-mail handlers. This greatly simplifies system management&nbsp;tasks.</p>

<p>On current hardware a single Zotonic server can handle thousands of dynamic page requests per second, thus easily serving the fast majority of web sites on the world wide&nbsp;web.</p>

<p>Using Erlang, Zotonic is prepared for the future of multi-core systems with dozens of cores and many gigabytes of&nbsp;memory.</p>
