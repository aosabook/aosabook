    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="author">Michael DiBernardo</p>

    <p>This is the fourth volume in the <em>Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>
series, and the first to not feature the words "open source applications"
anywhere in the title. </p>
<p>The first three volumes in the series were about big problems that big programs
have to solve. For an engineer who is early in their career, it may be a
challenge to understand and build upon programs that are much bigger than a
few thousand lines of code, so, while big problems can be interesting to
read about, they can also be challenging to learn from.</p>
<p><em>500 Lines or Less</em> focuses on the design decisions that programmers make
in the small when they are building something new. The programs you will read about
in this book were all written from scratch for this purpose (although several
of them were inspired by larger projects that the authors had worked on previously).</p>
<p>Before reading each chapter, we encourage you to first think about
how you might solve the problem. What design considerations
or constraints do you think the author is going to consider important? What
abstractions do you expect to see? How do you think the problem is going to be decomposed?
Then, when reading the chapter, try to identify what surprised you. It is our
hope that you will learn more by doing this than by simply reading through each
chapter from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Writing a useful program in fewer than 500 lines of source code---without
resorting to cheap tricks---is a challenging exercise in itself; writing one to
be read for pedagogical purposes when neatly rendered in a printed book is even
tougher. As such, the editors have occasionally taken liberties with some of
the source formatting when porting it into the book. The original source for
each chapter can be found in the <code>code</code> subdirectory of its project folder. </p>
<p>We hope that the experiences of the authors in this book will help you grow out
of your comfort zone in your own programming practice. </p>

<p><em>Daniel Rocco (Contingent)</em>: Daniel loves Python, coffee, craft, stout, object and system design, bourbon, teaching, trees, and Latin guitar. Thrilled that he gets to write Python for a living, he is always on the lookout for opportunities to learn from others in the community, and to contribute by sharing knowledge. He is a frequent speaker at PyAtl on introductory topics, testing, design, and shiny things; he loves seeing the spark of delight in people's eyes when someone shares a surprising or beautiful idea. Daniel lives in Atlanta with a microbiologist and four aspiring rocketeers.</p>
