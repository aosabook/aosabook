matplotlib is a Python-based plotting library with full support for 
2D and limited support for 3D graphics, widely used in
the Python scientific computing community.  The library targets a broad range of
use cases.  It can embed graphics in the user interface toolkit of
your choice, and currently supports interactive graphics on all major
desktop operating systems using the GTK+, Qt, Tk, FLTK, wxWidgets and
Cocoa toolkits.  It can be called interactively from the
interactive Python shell to produce graphics with simple, procedural
commands, much like Mathematica, IDL or
MATLAB.  matplotlib can also be embedded in a headless
webserver to provide hardcopy in both raster-based formats like
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and vector formats like
PostScript, Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) that look great on paper.

\begin{aosasect1}{The Dongle Problem}

matplotlib's origin dates to an attempt by one of us (John Hunter) to
free himself and his fellow epilepsy researchers from a proprietary
software package for doing electrocorticography (ECoG) analysis.  The
laboratory in which he worked had only one license for the software,
and the various graduate students, medical students, postdocs, interns,
and investigators took turns sharing the hardware key dongle.
MATLAB is widely used in the biomedical community for
data analysis and visualization, so Hunter set out, with some success,
to replace the proprietary software with a MATLAB-based version that
could be utilized and extended by multiple investigators.  MATLAB,
however, naturally views the world as an array of floating point
numbers, and the complexities of real-world hospital records for
epilepsy surgery patients with multiple data modalities (CT, MRI,
ECoG, EEG) warehoused on different servers pushed MATLAB to its limits
as a data management system.  Unsatisfied with the suitability of
MATLAB for this task, Hunter began working on a new Python application
built on top of the user interface toolkit GTK+, which was at the time
the leading desktop windowing system for Linux.

matplotlib was thus originally developed as an EEG/ECoG visualization
tool for this GTK+ application, and this use case directed its
original architecture.  matplotlib was originally designed to serve a
second purpose as well: as a replacement for interactive command-driven 
graphics generation, something that MATLAB does very well.  The
MATLAB design makes the simple task of loading a data file and
plotting very straightforward, where a full object-oriented API would
be too syntactically heavy.  So matplotlib also provides a stateful
scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics similar
to MATLAB's.  Because matplotlib is a library, users have access to
all of the rich built-in Python data structures such as lists,
dictionaries, sets and more.

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Overview of matplotlib Architecture}

The top-level matplotlib object that contains and manages all of the
elements in a given graphic is called the \code{Figure}.  One of the
core architectural tasks matplotlib must solve is implementing a
framework for representing and manipulating the \code{Figure} that
is segregated from the act of rendering the \code{Figure} to a user
interface window or hardcopy.  This enables us to build increasingly
sophisticated features and logic into the \code{Figure}s, while
keeping the ``backends'', or output devices, relatively simple.
matplotlib encapsulates not just the drawing interfaces to allow
rendering to multiple devices, but also the basic event
handling and windowing of most popular user interface toolkits.
Because of this, users can create fairly rich interactive graphics
and toolkits incorporating mouse and keyboard input that can be
plugged without modification into the six user interface toolkits we support.

The architecture to accomplish this is logically separated into three
layers, which can be viewed as a stack.  Each layer that sits above
another layer knows how to talk to the layer below it, but the lower
layer is not aware of the layers above it.  The three layers from
bottom to top are: backend, artist, and scripting.

% Minor point -- this starts talking about the top-level object, the
% Figure, then goes right to the bottom, the backend, and then back
% up.  Maybe it should be ordered strictly from top to bottom? Not
% sure that improves things. - MGD

\begin{aosasect2}{Backend Layer}

At the bottom of the stack is the \emph{backend} layer, which provides
concrete implementations of the abstract interface classes:
\begin{aosaitemize}
\item \code{FigureCanvas} encapsulates the concept of a surface to draw
  onto (e.g. ``the paper'').

\item \code{Renderer} does the drawing (e.g. ``the paintbrush'').

\item \code{Event} handles user inputs such as keyboard and mouse events.
\end{aosaitemize}

For a user interface toolkit such as Qt, the \code{FigureCanvas} has a
concrete implementation which knows how to insert itself into a native
Qt window (\code{QtGui.QMainWindow}), transfer the matplotlib Renderer
commands onto the canvas (\code{QtGui.QPainter}), and translate native
Qt events into the matplotlib \code{Event} framework, which signals the
callback dispatcher to generate the events so upstream listeners can
handle them.  The abstract base classes reside in
\code{matplotlib.backend\_bases} and all of the derived classes live
in dedicated modules like \code{matplotlib.backends.backend\_qt4agg}.
For a pure image backend dedicated to producing hardcopy output like
PDF, PNG, SVG, or PS, the \code{FigureCanvas} implementation might
simply set up a file-like object into which the default headers,
fonts, and macro functions are defined, as well as the individual
objects (lines, text, rectangles, etc.) that the \code{Renderer} creates.

The job of the \code{Renderer} is to provide a low-level drawing
interface for putting ink onto the canvas.  As mentioned above, the
original matplotlib application was an ECoG viewer in a GTK+
application, and much of the original design was inspired by the
GDK/GTK+ API available at that time.  The original \code{Renderer} API
was motivated by the GDK \code{Drawable} interface, which implements
such primitive methods as \code{draw\_point}, \code{draw\_line},
\code{draw\_rectangle}, \code{draw\_image}, \code{draw\_polygon}, and
\code{draw\_glyphs}.  Each additional backend we implemented---the
earliest were the PostScript backend and the GD backend---implemented
the GDK \code{Drawable} API and translated these into native 
backend-dependent drawing commands.  As we discuss below, this unnecessarily
complicated the implementation of new backends with a large
proliferation of methods, and this API has subsequently been
dramatically simplified, resulting in a simple process for porting
matplotlib to a new user interface toolkit or file specification.

One of the design decisions that has worked quite well for matplotlib
is support for a core pixel-based renderer using the C++ template
library Anti-Grain Geometry or ``agg'' \cite{bib:agg}.  This is a
high-performance library for rendering anti-aliased 2D graphics that
produces attractive images.  matplotlib provides support for inserting
pixel buffers rendered by the agg backend into each user interface
toolkit we support, so one can get pixel-exact graphics across UIs and
operating systems.  Because the PNG output matplotlib produces also
uses the agg renderer, the hardcopy is identical to the screen
display, so what you see is what you get across UIs, operating systems
and PNG output.

The matplotlib \code{Event} framework maps underlying UI events like
\code{key-press-event} or \linebreak \code{mouse-motion-event} to the
matplotlib classes \code{KeyEvent} or \code{MouseEvent}.
Users can connect to these events to callback functions and
interact with their figure and data; for example, to \code{pick}
a data point or group of points, or manipulate some aspect of the 
figure or its constituents.  The following code sample illustrates
how to toggle all of the lines in an \code{Axes} window when the
user types `t'.

%% fixme: The first two lines of this code are orphaned over a page turn -- 
%% maybe force a new page before? --ARB

\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def on_press(event):
    if event.inaxes is None: return
    for line in event.inaxes.lines:
        if event.key=='t':
            visible = line.get_visible()
            line.set_visible(not visible)
    event.inaxes.figure.canvas.draw()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)

fig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_press)

ax.plot(np.random.rand(2, 20))

plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

The abstraction of the underlying UI toolkit's event framework allows
both matplotlib developers and end-users to write UI event-handling 
code in a ``write once run everywhere'' fashion. For example,
the interactive panning and zooming of matplotlib figures that works
across all user interface toolkits is implemented in the matplotlib
event framework.

\end{aosasect2}

\begin{aosasect2}{Artist Layer}

The \code{Artist} hierarchy is the middle layer of the matplotlib
stack, and is the place where much of the heavy lifting happens.
Continuing with the analogy that the \code{FigureCanvas} from the
backend is the paper, the \code{Artist} is the object that knows how
to take the \code{Renderer} (the paintbrush) and put ink on the
canvas.  Everything you see in a matplotlib \code{Figure} is an
\code{Artist} instance; the title, the lines, the tick labels, the
images, and so on all correspond to individual \code{Artist} instances
(see \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.artiststree}).  The base class is
\code{matplotlib.artist.Artist}, which contains attributes that every
\code{Artist} shares: the transformation which translates the artist
coordinate system to the canvas coordinate system (discussed in more
detail below), the visibility, the clip box which defines the region
the artist can paint into, the label, and the interface to handle user
interaction such as ``picking''; that is, detecting when a mouse click
happens over the artist.

\aosafigure[260pt]{../images/matplotlib/artists_figure.pdf}{A figure}{fig.matplotlib.artistsfigure}

\aosafigure[300pt]{../images/matplotlib/artists_tree.pdf}{The hierarchy of artist instances used to draw \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.artistsfigure}.}{fig.matplotlib.artiststree}

The coupling between the \code{Artist} hierarchy and the backend
happens in the \code{draw} method.  For example, in the mockup class below
where we create \code{SomeArtist} which subclasses \code{Artist}, the
essential method that \code{SomeArtist} must implement is \code{draw},
which is passed a renderer from the backend.
The \code{Artist} doesn't know what kind of backend the renderer is going to
draw onto (PDF, SVG, GTK+ DrawingArea, etc.) but it does know the
\code{Renderer} API and will call the appropriate method
(\code{draw\_text} or \code{draw\_path}).  Since the \code{Renderer} has
a pointer to its canvas and knows how to paint onto it, the \code{draw}
method transforms the abstract representation of the \code{Artist} to
colors in a pixel buffer, paths in an SVG file, or any other
concrete representation.

\begin{verbatim}
class SomeArtist(Artist):
    'An example Artist that implements the draw method'

    def draw(self, renderer):
        """Call the appropriate renderer methods to paint self onto canvas"""
        if not self.get_visible():  return

        # create some objects and use renderer to draw self here
        renderer.draw_path(graphics_context, path, transform)

\end{verbatim}

There are two types of \code{Artist}s in the
hierarchy. \emph{Primitive} artists represent the kinds of objects you
see in a plot: \code{Line2D}, \code{Rectangle}, \code{Circle}, and
\code{Text}.  \emph{Composite} artists are collections of
\code{Artist}s such as the \code{Axis}, \code{Tick}, \code{Axes}, and
\code{Figure}.  Each composite artist may contain other composite
artists as well as primitive artists. For example, the \code{Figure} contains
one or more composite \code{Axes} and the background of the
\code{Figure} is a primitive \code{Rectangle}.

The most important composite artist is the \code{Axes}, which is where most
of the matplotlib API plotting methods are defined.  Not only does the
\code{Axes} contain most of the graphical elements that make up the
background of the plot---the ticks, the axis lines, the grid, the
patch of color which is the plot background---it contains numerous
helper methods that create primitive artists and add them to the \code{Axes}
instance.  For example, \aosatblref{tbl.matplotlib.axmethods} shows
a small sampling of \code{Axes} methods that create plot objects and store
them in the \code{Axes} instance.

\begin{table}[h!]\centering
\begin{tabular}[c] { l l l }
\hline
\textbf{method}            & \textbf{creates}                                         & \textbf{stored in}   \\
\hline
\code{Axes.imshow}         &  one or more \code{matplotlib.image.AxesImage}s          & \code{Axes.images}   \\
\code{Axes.hist}           &  many \code{matplotlib.patch.Rectangle}s                 & \code{Axes.patches}  \\
\code{Axes.plot}           &  one or more \code{matplotlib.lines.Line2D}s             & \code{Axes.lines}    \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Sampling of \code{Axes} methods and the \code{Artist} instances they create}
\label{tbl.matplotlib.axmethods}
\end{table}


\end{aosasect2}

Below is a simple Python script illustrating the architecture above.
It defines the backend, connects a \code{Figure} to it, uses the array
library \code{numpy} to create 10,000 normally distributed random numbers,
and plots a histogram of these.

%% fixme: Once again the first line of this is orphaned over a page turn --
%% maybe force a page break? --ARB

\begin{verbatim}
# Import the FigureCanvas from the backend of your choice
#  and attach the Figure artist to it.
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
fig = Figure()
canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)

# Import the numpy library to generate the random numbers.
import numpy as np
x = np.random.randn(10000)

# Now use a figure method to create an Axes artist; the Axes artist is
#  added automatically to the figure container fig.axes.
# Here "111" is from the MATLAB convention: create a grid with 1 row and 1
#  column, and use the first cell in that grid for the location of the new
#  Axes.
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

# Call the Axes method hist to generate the histogram; hist creates a
#  sequence of Rectangle artists for each histogram bar and adds them
#  to the Axes container.  Here "100" means create 100 bins.
ax.hist(x, 100)

# Decorate the figure with a title and save it.
ax.set_title('Normal distribution with $\mu=0,\ \sigma=1$')
fig.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')
\end{verbatim}

\begin{aosasect2}{Scripting Layer (pyplot)}

The script using the API above works very well, especially for programmers,
and is usually the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a
web application server, a UI application, or perhaps a script to be
shared with other developers.  For everyday purposes, particularly
for interactive exploratory work by bench scientists who are not
professional programmers, it is a bit syntactically heavy.  Most
special-purpose languages for data analysis and visualization
provide a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks, and
matplotlib does so as well in its \code{matplotlib.pyplot}
interface.  The same code above, using \code{pyplot}, reads

\begin{verbatim}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randn(10000)
plt.hist(x, 100)
plt.title(r'Normal distribution with $\mu=0, \sigma=1$')
plt.savefig('matplotlib_histogram.png')
plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

\aosafigure[250pt]{../images/matplotlib/histogram_demo.pdf}{A histogram created using pyplot}{fig.matplotlib.hist}

\code{pyplot} is a stateful interface that handles much of the boilerplate
for creating figures and axes and connecting them to the backend of
your choice, and maintains module-level internal data structures
representing the current figure and axes to which to direct plotting
commands.

Let's dissect the important lines in the script to see how this
internal state is managed.

\begin{aosaitemize}

\item \code{import matplotlib.pyplot as plt}: When the \code{pyplot} module
  is loaded, it parses a local configuration file in which the user
  states, among many other things, their preference for a default
  backend.  This might be a user interface backend like \code{QtAgg},
  in which case the script above will import the GUI framework and
  launch a Qt window with the plot embedded, or it might be a pure
  image backend like \code{Agg}, in which case the script will
  generate the hard-copy output and exit.

\item \code{plt.hist(x,\,100)}: This is the first plotting command in
  the script.  \code{pyplot} will check its internal data structures to see
  if there is a current \code{Figure} instance.  If so, it will
  extract the current \code{Axes} and direct plotting to the
  \code{Axes.hist} API call.  In this case there is none, so it will
  create a \code{Figure} and \code{Axes}, set these as current, and
  direct the plotting to \code{Axes.hist}.

\item \verb+plt.title(r'Normal distribution with $\mu=0, \sigma=1$')+:
  As above, pyplot will look to see if there is a
  current \code{Figure} and \code{Axes}.  Finding that there is, it
  will not create new instances but will direct the call to the
  existing \code{Axes} instance method \code{Axes.set\_title}.

\item \code{plt.show()}: This will force the \code{Figure} to render,
  and if the user has indicated a default GUI backend in their
  configuration file, will start the GUI mainloop and raise any
  figures created to the screen.

\end{aosaitemize}

A somewhat stripped-down and simplified version of \code{pyplot}'s
frequently used line plotting function \code{matplotlib.pyplot.plot}
is shown below to illustrate how a pyplot function wraps functionality
in matplotlib's object-oriented core.  All other \code{pyplot} scripting
interface functions follow the same design.

\begin{verbatim}
@autogen_docstring(Axes.plot)
def plot(*args, **kwargs):
    ax = gca()

    ret = ax.plot(*args, **kwargs)
    draw_if_interactive()

    return ret
\end{verbatim}

The Python decorator \code{@autogen\_docstring(Axes.plot)} extracts
the documentation string from the corresponding API method and
attaches a properly formatted version to the \code{pyplot.plot}
method; we have a dedicated module \code{matplotlib.docstring} to
handle this docstring magic.  The \code{*args} and \code{**kwargs} in
the documentation signature are special conventions in Python to mean
all the arguments and keyword arguments that are passed to the method.
This allows us to forward them on to the corresponding API method.
The call \code{ax = gca()} invokes the stateful machinery to ``get
current Axes'' (each Python interpreter can have only one ``current
axes''), and will create the \code{Figure} and \code{Axes} if
necessary.  The call to \code{ret = ax.plot(*args, **kwargs)} forwards
the function call and its arguments to the appropriate \code{Axes}
method, and stores the return value to be returned later.  Thus the
\code{pyplot} interface is a fairly thin wrapper around the core
\code{Artist} API which tries to avoid as much code duplication as
possible by exposing the API function, call signature and docstring in
the scripting interface with a minimal amount of boilerplate code.

\end{aosasect2}

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Backend Refactoring}

% Do we want to move this section to the backend layer section above? - MGD

Over time, the drawing API of the output backends grew a large number
of methods, including:

\begin{verbatim}
draw_arc, draw_image, draw_line_collection, draw_line, draw_lines, draw_point,
draw_quad_mesh, draw_polygon_collection, draw_polygon, draw_rectangle,
draw_regpoly_collection
\end{verbatim}

Unfortunately, having more backend methods meant it took much longer
to write a new backend, and as new features were added to the core,
updating the existing backends took considerable work.  Since each of
the backends was implemented by a single developer who was expert in a
particular output file format, it sometimes took a long time for a new
feature to arrive in all of the backends, causing confusion for the
user about which features were available where.

For matplotlib version 0.98, the backends were refactored to require
only the minimum necessary functionality in the backends themselves,
with everything else moved into the core.  The number of required
methods in the backend API was reduced considerably, to only:

\begin{aosaitemize}

  \item \code{draw\_path}: Draws compound polygons, made up of line and
    B\'ezier segments.  This interfaces replaces many of the old
    methods: \code{draw\_arc}, \code{draw\_line}, \code{draw\_lines},
    and \code{draw\_rectangle}.

  \item \code{draw\_image}: Draws raster images.

  \item \code{draw\_text}: Draws text with the given font properties.

  \item \code{get\_text\_width\_height\_descent}: Given a string of
    text, return its metrics.

\end{aosaitemize}

It's possible to implement all of the drawing necessary for a new
backend using only these methods.\footnote{We could also go one step
  further and draw text using \code{draw\_path}, removing the
  need for the \code{draw\_text} method, but we haven't gotten
  around to making that simplification.  Of course, a backend would
  still be free to implement its own \code{draw\_text} method to
  output ``real'' text.}  This is useful for getting a new backend
up and running more easily.  However, in some cases, a backend may
want to override the behavior of the core in order to create more
efficient output.  For example, when drawing markers (small symbols
used to indicate the vertices in a line plot), it is more
space-efficient to write the marker's shape only once to the file, and
then repeat it as a ``stamp'' everywhere it is used.  In that case,
the backend can implement a \code{draw\_markers} method.  If it's
implemented, the backend writes out the marker shape once and then
writes out a much shorter command to reuse it in a number of
locations.  If it's not implemented, the core simply draws the marker
multiple times using multiple calls to \code{draw\_path}.

The full list of optional backend API methods is:

\begin{aosaitemize}

  \item \code{draw\_markers}: Draws a set of markers.

  \item \code{draw\_path\_collection}: Draws a collection of paths.

  \item \code{draw\_quad\_mesh}: Draws a quadrilateral mesh.

\end{aosaitemize}

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Transforms}

% Do we want to move this section to the artist layer section above? -
% MGD

matplotlib spends a lot of time transforming coordinates from one
system to another.  These coordinate systems include:

%% fixme: The first item in this list is widowed - try and fix before
%% publication.  --ARB
\begin{aosaitemize}
\item \textbf{data:} the original raw data values

\item \textbf{axes:} the space defined by a particular axes rectangle

\item \textbf{figure:} the space containing the entire figure

\item \textbf{display:} the physical coordinates used in the output
  (e.g. points in PostScript, pixels in PNG)
\end{aosaitemize}

Every \code{Artist} has a transformation node that knows how to
transform from one coordinate system to another.  These transformation
nodes are connected together in a directed graph, where each node is
dependent on its parent.  By following the edges to the root of the
graph, coordinates in data space can be transformed all the way to
coordinates in the final output file.  Most transformations are
invertible, as well.  This makes it possible to click on an element of
the plot and return its coordinate in data space.  The transform graph
sets up dependencies between transformation nodes: when a parent
node's transformation changes, such as when an \code{Axes}'s limits are
changed, any transformations related to that \code{Axes} are invalidated
since they will need to be redrawn.  Transformations related to other
\code{Axes} in the figure, of course, may be left alone, preventing
unnecessary recomputations and contributing to better interactive
performance.

Transform nodes may be either simple affine transformations and
non-affine transformations.  Affine transformations are the family of
transformations that preserve straight lines and ratios of distances,
including rotation, translation, scale and skew.  Two-dimensional
affine transformations are represented using a $3 \times 3$ affine
transformation matrix.  The transformed point $(x\prime, y\prime)$ is
obtained by matrix-multiplying the original point $(x, y)$ by this
matrix:

\medskip
\hspace{20pt}
\begin{math}
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} s_x & \theta_x & t_x \\ \theta_y & s_y & t_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{math}
\medskip

Two-dimensional coordinates can then easily be transformed by simply
multiplying them by the transformation matrix.  Affine transformations
also have the useful property that they can be composed together using
matrix multiplication.  This means that to perform a series of affine
transformations, the transformation matrices can first be multiplied
together only once, and the resulting matrix can be used to transform
coordinates.  matplotlib's transformation framework automatically
composes (freezes) affine transformation matrices together before
transforming coordinates to reduce the amount of computation.  Having
fast affine transformations is important, because it makes interactive
panning and zooming in a GUI window more efficient.

\aosafigure{../images/matplotlib/nonaffine_transforms.pdf}{The same data plotted with three different non-affine transformations: logarithmic, polar and Lambert}{fig.matplotlib.nonaffine}

Non-affine transformations in matplotlib are defined using Python
functions, so they are truly arbitrary.  Within the matplotlib core,
non-affine transformations are used for logarithmic scaling, polar
plots and geographical projections (\aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.nonaffine}).
These non-affine transformations can be freely mixed with affine ones
in the transformation graph.  matplotlib will automatically simplify
the affine portion and only fall back to the arbitrary functions for
the non-affine portion.

From these simple pieces, matplotlib can do some pretty advanced
things.  A blended transformation is a special transformation node
that uses one transformation for the $x$ axis and another for the $y$
axis.  This is of course only possible if the given transformations
are ``separable'', meaning the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are
independent, but the transformations themselves may be either affine
or non-affine.  This is used, for example, to plot logarithmic plots
where either or both of the $x$ and $y$ axes may have a logarithmic
scale.  Having a blended transformation node allow the available
scales to be combined in arbitrary ways.  Another thing the transform
graph allows is the sharing of axes.  It is possible to ``link'' the
limits of one plot to another and ensure that when one is panned or
zoomed, the other is updated to match.  In this case, the same
transform node is simply shared between two axes, which may even be on
two different figures.  \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.transformtree}
shows an example transformation graph with some of these advanced
features at work.  axes1 has a logarithmic $x$ axis;  axes1 and axes2
share the same $y$ axis.

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{The Polyline Pipeline}

When plotting line plots, there are a number of steps that are
performed to get from the raw data to the line drawn on screen.  In an
earlier version of matplotlib, all of these steps were tangled
together.  They have since been refactored so they are discrete steps
in a ``path conversion'' pipeline.  This allows each backend to choose
which parts of the pipeline to perform, since some are only useful in
certain contexts.

\aosafigure[200pt]{../images/matplotlib/pixel_snapping.pdf}{A close-up view of the effect of pixel snapping.  On the left, without pixel snapping; on the right, with pixel snapping.}{fig.matplotlib.pixelsnapping}

\begin{aosaitemize}

\item \textbf{Transformation:} The coordinates are transformed from data
  coordinates to figure coordinates.  If this is a purely affine
  transformation, as described above, this is as simple as a matrix
  multiplication.  If this involves arbitrary transformations,
  transformation functions are called to transform the coordinates
  into figure space.

\item \textbf{Handle missing data:} The data array may have portions
  where the data is missing or invalid.  The user may indicate this
  either by setting those values to \code{NaN}, or using \code{numpy} masked arrays.
  Vector output formats, such as PDF, and rendering libraries, such as
  Agg, do not often have a concept of missing data when plotting a
  polyline, so this step of the pipeline must skip over the missing
  data segments using \code{MOVETO} commands, which tell the renderer
  to pick up the pen and begin drawing again at a new point.

\item \textbf{Clipping:} Points outside of the boundaries of the
  figure can increase the file size by including many invisible
  points.  More importantly, very large or very small coordinate
  values can cause overflow errors in the rendering of the output
  file, which results in completely garbled output.  This step of the
  pipeline clips the polyline as it enters and exits the edges of the
  figure to prevent both of these problems.

\item \textbf{Snapping:} Perfectly vertical and horizontal lines can
  look fuzzy due to antialiasing when their centers are not aligned to
  the center of a pixel (see
  \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.pixelsnapping}).  The snapping step of
  the pipeline first determines whether the entire polyline is made up
  of horizontal and vertical segments (such as an axis-aligned
  rectangle), and if so, rounds each resulting vertex to the nearest
  pixel center.  This step is only used for raster backends, since
  vector backends should continue to have exact data points.  Some
  renderers of vector file formats, such as Adobe Acrobat, perform
  pixel snapping when viewed on screen.

\item \textbf{Simplification:} When plotting really dense plots, many
  of the points on the line may not actually be visible.  This is
  particularly true of plots representing a noisy waveform.  Including
  these points in the plot increases file size, and may even hit
  limits on the number of points allowed in the file format.
  Therefore, any points that lie exactly on the line between their two
  neighboring points are removed (see
  \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.pathsimplification}).  The determination
  depends on a threshold based on what would be visible at a given
  resolution specified by the user.

\aosafigure{../images/matplotlib/path_simplification.pdf}{The figure on the right is a close-up of the figure on the left.  The circled vertex is automatically removed by the path simplification algorithm, since it lies exactly on the line between its neighboring vertices, and therefore is redundant.}{fig.matplotlib.pathsimplification}

\begin{aosasect1}{Math Text}

Since the users of matplotlib are often scientists, it is useful to
put richly formatted math expressions directly on the plot.  Perhaps
the most widely used syntax for math expressions is from Donald
Knuth's TeX typesetting system.  It's a way to turn input in a
plain-text language like this: 

\begin{verbatim}
\sqrt{\frac{\delta x}{\delta y}}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent into a properly formatted math expression like this:

\vspace{10px}
$\sqrt{\frac{\delta x}{\delta y}}$
\vspace{10px}

matplotlib provides two ways to render math expressions.  The first,
\code{usetex}, uses a full copy of TeX on the user's machine to render the
math expression.  TeX outputs the location of the characters and
lines in the expression in its native DVI (device independent) format.
matplotlib then parses the DVI file and converts it to a set of
drawing commands that one of its output backends then renders directly
onto the plot.  This approach handles a great deal of obscure math
syntax. However, it requires that the user have a full and working
installation of TeX.  Therefore, matplotlib also includes its own
internal math rendering engine, called \code{mathtext}.

\code{mathtext} is a direct port of the TeX math-rendering engine, glued
onto a much simpler parser written using the \code{pyparsing}
\cite{bib:pyparsing} parsing framework.  This port was written based
on the published copy of the TeX source code \cite{bib:texprogram}.
The simple parser builds up a tree of \emph{boxes} and \emph{glue} (in TeX
nomenclature), that are then laid out by the layout engine.  While the
complete TeX math rendering engine is included, the large set of
third-party TeX and LaTeX math libraries is not.  Features in such
libraries are ported on an as-needed basis, with an emphasis on
frequently used and non-discipline-specific features first.  This
makes for a nice, lightweight way to render most math expressions.

\begin{aosasect1}{Regression Testing}

Historically, matplotlib has not had a large number of low-level
unit tests.  Occasionally, if a serious bug was reported, a script
to reproduce it would be added to a directory of such files in the
source tree.  The lack of automated tests created all of the usual
problems, most importantly regressions in features that previously
worked.  (We probably don't need to sell you on the idea that
automated testing is a good thing.)  Of course, with so much code
and so many configuration options and interchangeable pieces
(e.g., the backends), it is arguable that low-level unit tests alone
would ever be enough; instead we've followed the belief that it is
most cost-effective to test all of the pieces working together in
concert.

To this end, as a first effort, a script was written that generated a
number of plots exercising various features of matplotlib,
particularly those that were hard to get right.  This made it a little
easier to detect when a new change caused inadvertent breakage, but
the correctness of the images still needed to be verified by hand.
Since this required a lot of manual effort, it wasn't done very often.

As a second pass, this general approach was automated.  The current
matplotlib testing script generates a number of plots, but instead of
requiring manual intervention, those plots are automatically compared
to baseline images.  All of the tests are run inside of the nose
testing framework, which makes it very easy to generate a report of
which tests failed.

Complicating matters is that the image comparison cannot be exact.
Subtle changes in versions of the Freetype font-rendering library can
make the output of text slightly different across different machines.
These differences are not enough to be considered ``wrong'', but are
enough to throw off any exact bit-for-bit comparison.  Instead, the
testing framework computes the histogram of both images, and
calculates the root-mean-square of their difference.  If that
difference is greater than a given threshold, the images are
considered too different and the comparison test fails.  When tests
fail, difference images are generated which show where on the plot a
change has occurred (see \aosafigref{fig.matplotlib.regression}).  The
developer can then decide whether the failure is due to an intentional
change and update the baseline image to match the new image, or
decide the image is in fact incorrect and track down and fix the bug
that caused the change.

\aosafigure{../images/matplotlib/regression.pdf}{A regression test image comparison.  From left to right: a) The expected image, b) the result of broken legend placement, c) the difference between the two images.}{fig.matplotlib.regression}

Since different backends can contribute different bugs, the testing
framework tests multiple backends for each plot: PNG, PDF and SVG.
For the vector formats, we don't compare the vector information
directly, since there are multiple ways to represent something that
has the same end result when rasterized.  The vector backends should
be free to change the specifics of their output to increase efficiency
without causing all of the tests to fail.  Therefore, for vector
backends, the testing framework first renders the file to a raster
using an external tool (Ghostscript for PDF and Inkscape for SVG) and
then uses those rasters for comparison.

Using this approach, we were able to bootstrap a reasonably effective
testing framework from scratch more easily than if we had gone on to
write many low-level unit tests.  Still, it is not perfect;  the code
coverage of the tests is not very complete, and it takes a long time to
run all of the tests.\footnote{Around 15 minutes on a 2.33 GHz Intel
  Core 2 E6550.}  Therefore, some regressions do still fall through
the cracks, but overall the quality of the releases has improved
considerably since the testing framework was implemented.

\begin{aosasect1}{Lessons Learned}

One of the important lessons from the development of matplotlib is,
as Le Corbusier said, ``Good architects borrow''.  The early authors
of matplotlib were largely scientists, self-taught programmers
trying to get their work done, not formally trained computer
scientists. Thus we did not get the internal design right on the
first try. The decision to implement a user-facing scripting layer
largely compatible with the MATLAB API benefited the project in
three significant ways: it provided a time-tested interface to
create and customize graphics, it made for an easy transition to
matplotlib from the large base of MATLAB users, and---most importantly
for us in the context of matplotlib architecture---it freed
developers to refactor the internal object-oriented API several
times with minimal impact to most users because the scripting
interface was unchanged.  While we have had API users (as opposed to
scripting users) from the outset, most of them are power users or
developers able to adapt to API changes.  The scripting users, on
the other hand, can write code once and pretty much assume it is
stable for all subsequent releases.

For the internal drawing API, while we did borrow from GDK, we did not
spend enough effort determining whether this was the right drawing
API, and had to expend considerable effort subsequently after many
backends were written around this API to extend the functionality
around a simpler and more flexible drawing API.  We would have been
well-served by adopting the PDF drawing specification \cite{bib:pdf},
which itself was developed from decades of experience Adobe had with
its PostScript specification; it would have given us mostly
out-of-the-box compatibility with PDF itself, the Quartz Core Graphics
framework, and the Enthought Enable Kiva drawing kit \cite{bib:kiva}.

One of the curses of Python is that it is such an easy and expressive
language that developers often find it easier to re-invent and
re-implement functionality that exists in other packages than
work to integrate code from other packages.  matplotlib could have
benefited in early development from expending more effort on
integration with existing modules and APIs such as Enthought's Kiva
and Enable toolkits which solve many similar problems, rather than
reinventing functionality.  Integration with existing functionality
is, however, a double-edged sword, as it can make builds and releases
more complex and reduce flexibility in internal development.
