<p>Carpentry is an exacting craft, and people can spend their entire
lives learning how to do it well.  But carpentry is not architecture:
if we step back from pitch boards and miter joints, buildings as a
whole must be designed, and doing that is as much an art as it is a
craft or science.</p>

<p>Programming is also an exacting craft, and people can spend their entire lives
learning how to do it well.  But programming is not software architecture.
Many programmers spend years thinking about
(or wrestling with) larger design issues: Should this application be
extensible?  If so, should that be done by providing a scripting
interface, through some sort of plugin mechanism, or in some other way
entirely?  What should be done by the client, what should be left to
the server, and is "client-server" even a useful way to think about
this application?  These are not programming questions, any more than
where to put the stairs is a question of carpentry.</p>

<p>Building architecture and software architecture have a lot in common,
but there is one crucial difference.  While architects study
thousands of buildings in their training and during their careers,
most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large
programs well.  And more often than not, those are programs they wrote
themselves.  They never get to see the great programs of history, or
read critiques of those programs' design written by experienced
practitioners.  As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather
than building on one another's successes.</p>

<p>This book is our attempt to change that.  Each chapter describes the
architecture of an open source application: how it is structured, how
its parts interact, why it's built that way, and what lessons have
been learned that can be applied to other big design problems.  The
descriptions are written by the people who know the software
best, people with years or decades of experience designing and
re-designing complex applications.  The applications themselves range
in scale from simple drawing programs and web-based spreadsheets to
compiler toolkits and multi-million line visualization packages.  Some
are only a few years old, while others are approaching their thirtieth
anniversary.  What they have in common is that their creators have
thought long and hard about their design, and are willing to share
those thoughts with you.  We hope you enjoy what they have written.</p>
