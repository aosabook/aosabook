- Warp is a high-performance HTTP engine library in Haskell.

- Both Yesod, a web application framework, and Mighttpd, an HTTP server,
  are implemented over Warp.

- This article explains the architecture of Warp and techniques to achieve
  its high performance.

- It is said that event-driven network programming is necessary to
  implement high-performance server. But event-driven programming is
  prone to be a mess of callback functions.

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) successfully provides user threads
  (not native threads) over an event-driven IO manager.

- Haskell user threads achieve high-performance while keeping server
  code simple and concise by allowing traditional thread programming.

- Warp consists of an HTTP request parser and an HTTP response generator.

- Implement efficient parsing of the requests. Bypassing parser
  generators and writing the parsers by hand has given us significant
  performance boosts, and the low-level ByteString functions have
  allowed us to avoid redundant checks.

- Avoiding multiple buffer copies. It's worth mentioning that we
  transitioned from straight ByteStrings, to blaze-builder, and now
  use our even more optimized buffer builder code for certain parts
  of response generation.

- Since issuing a system call gives CPU time to the kernel, all Haskell
  user threads stop. To implement high-performace server, we need to
  avoid issuing system calls as much as possible.

   - Cache results of system calls: open, close, stat, gettimeofday
   - Use better system calls: accept4 instead of accept,
                              sento + MSG_MORE instead of writev

- We need to avoid re-calculation, of course.
   - Cache formatted date
   - Pre-prepare pieces of HTTP response header (e.g "200")

 - With these ideas, we can implement fast servers even with a
   high-level programming language like Haskell.
