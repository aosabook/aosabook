<p>In the introduction to Volume 1 of this series, we wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
Building architecture and software architecture have a lot in common,
but there is one crucial difference.  While architects study thousands
of buildings in their training and during their careers, most software
developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs
well&hellip; As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather
than building on one another's successes&hellip; This book is our
attempt to change that.
</blockquote>

<p>In the year since that book appeared, over two dozen people have
worked hard to create the sequel you have in your hands.  They have
done so because they believe, as we do, that software design can and
should be taught by example&mdash;that the best way to learn how think
like an expert is to study how experts think.  From web servers and
compilers through health record management systems to the
infrastructure that Mozilla uses to get Firefox out the door, there
are lessons all around us.  We hope that by collecting some of them
together in this book, we can help you become a better developer.</p>

<p>&mdash; Amy Brown and Greg Wilson</p>

control case), Stan went to Cygnus Support, where he maintained GDB
for the FSF and helped on many embedded tools projects.  Returning to
Apple in 2000, he worked on GCC and GDB for Mac OS X.  A short time at
Mozilla preceded a jump to CodeSourcery, now part of Mentor Graphics,
