<p><span class="caps">XML</span> is a standardized markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding hierarchically structured documents in a human-readable text-based format. <span class="caps">XML</span> is in widespread use, with documents ranging from very short and simple (such as <span class="caps">SOAP</span> queries) to multi-gigabyte documents (OpenStreetMap) with complicated data relationships (<span class="caps">COLLADA</span>). In order to process <span class="caps">XML</span> documents, users typically need a special library: an <span class="caps">XML</span> parser, which converts the document from text to internal representation. <span class="caps">XML</span> is a compromise between parsing performance, human readability and parsing-code complexity&#8211;therefore a fast <span class="caps">XML</span> parser can make the choice of <span class="caps">XML</span> as an underlying format for application data model more&nbsp;preferable.</p>

<p>This chapter describes various performance tricks that allowed the author to write a very high-performing parser in C++: <a href="http://pugixml.org">pugixml</a>. While the techniques were used for an <span class="caps">XML</span> parser, most of them can be applied to parsers of other formats or even unrelated software (e.g., memory management algorithms are widely applicable beyond&nbsp;parsers).</p>

<p>Since there are several substantially different approaches to <span class="caps">XML</span> parsing, and the parser has to do additional processing that even people familiar with <span class="caps">XML</span> do not know about, it is important to outline the entire task at hand first, before diving into implementation&nbsp;details.</p>

<h2 id="xml-parsing-models"><span class="caps">XML</span> parsing&nbsp;models</h2>

<p>Each of the different models of <span class="caps">XML</span> parsing is appropriate in different situations, and each has implications for performance and memory consumption. The following models are in widespread&nbsp;use:</p>

<ul>
<li>With <span class="caps">SAX</span> (Simple <span class="caps">API</span> for <span class="caps">XML</span>) parsers, the user provides the parser with a document stream as an input and several callbacks such as &#8220;start of tag,&#8221; &#8220;end of tag,&#8221; &#8220;character data inside tag&#8221;. The parser invokes the callbacks according to the data in the document. The context needed for parsing is limited by the tree depth of the current element, which means that the memory requirements are greatly reduced. This type of parsing can be used for streaming documents where only part of the document is available at any single&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>Pull parsing is similar to <span class="caps">SAX</span> in the parsing process&#8211;that is, the document is processed one element at a time&#8211;but the control is inverted: in <span class="caps">SAX</span>, parsing is controlled by the parser through callbacks, whereas in Pull parsing the user controls the parsing process through an iterator-like&nbsp;object.</li>
<li>With <span class="caps">DOM</span> (Document Object Model) parsers, the user provides the parser with the entire document as a text stream/buffer, from which the parser generates a document object&#8211;an in-memory representation of the entire document tree, which has an individual object for each specific <span class="caps">XML</span> element or attribute, and a set of allowed operations (e.g., &#8220;get all child elements of this node&#8221;). Pugixml follows this&nbsp;model.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of the parsing model usually depends on the document size and structure. Since pugixml is a <span class="caps">DOM</span> parser, it is effective for documents&nbsp;that:</p>

<ul>
<li>are small enough to fit in&nbsp;memory,</li>
<li>have a complicated structure with references between nodes that need to be traversed,&nbsp;or</li>
<li>need complicated document&nbsp;transformations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-choices-in-pugixml">Design choices in&nbsp;pugixml</h2>

<p>Pugixml focuses on the problem of <span class="caps">DOM</span> parsing largely because, while fast and lightweight <span class="caps">SAX</span> parsers (such as Expat) were available, all production-ready <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="caps">DOM</span> parsers at the time of pugixml&#8217;s creation (2006) were either not very lightweight, not very fast or&#8211;usually&#8211;neither. Thus the main goal of pugixml is to be a very fast lightweight <span class="caps">DOM</span>-based <span class="caps">XML</span> manipulation&nbsp;library.</p>

<p><span class="caps">XML</span> is defined by a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/"><span class="caps">W3C</span> recommendation</a> that specifies two different types of parsing: validating and non-validating (in other words, non-validating parsers check <span class="caps">XML</span> syntax while validating parsers can check data semantics as well). Even a non-validating parser has to do some relatively resource-intensive validation&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>When performance is the primary goal, a compromise must be reached between performance and conformance. For pugixml the compromise is as follows: any well-formed <span class="caps">XML</span> document will be fully parsed, including all required transformations, with the exception of document type declarations.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Since only rules that are fast to verify are checked, a non-well-formed document can sometimes be parsed&nbsp;successfully.</p>

<p>The data in an <span class="caps">XML</span> document often has to be transformed in certain ways by the time it reaches the user. The transformations include end-of-line handling, attribute-value normalization and character reference expansion. These transformations have an associated performance cost; pugixml optimizes them as much as possible while providing a way to disable them for maximum&nbsp;performance.</p>

<p>The task at hand is to make a fast <span class="caps">DOM</span> parser that successfully parses conforming <span class="caps">XML</span> documents with required transformations, is as fast as reasonably possible, and is production ready. For performance purposes, &#8220;production ready&#8221; mainly means it offers resistance to malformed data. Sacrificing buffer overrun checks to improve performance is not&nbsp;feasible.</p>

<p>Next, we&#8217;ll discuss the parsing process used by pugixml. The last sections will describe the data structure used by pugixml to store the document object model and the algorithm used by pugixml to allocate memory for this data&nbsp;structure.</p>

<h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2>

<p>The goal of a <span class="caps">DOM</span> parser is to take an input&#8211;a string that contains an <span class="caps">XML</span> document&#8211;and produce a tree of objects that represents the same document in memory. A parser typically consists of two stages: a lexer and a parser. A lexer is given an input character stream and produces a token stream. (For an <span class="caps">XML</span> parser the set of tokens can include open angle brackets, quotation marks, tag names, and attribute names.) The parser consumes the token stream and produces a syntax tree based on the grammar, using one of many parsing algorithms such as recursive descent. When encountering a token with string data, such as a tag name, the lexer or parser copies the string contents to a heap and stores a reference to the string inside a tree&nbsp;node.</p>

<p>To improve parsing performance, pugixml deviates from the typical approach in several&nbsp;ways.</p>

<h3 id="token-stream-vs.-character-stream">Token stream vs. character&nbsp;stream</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, parsers traditionally use lexers to convert the character stream into a token stream. This can improve performance in cases where a parser has to do a lot of backtracking, but for <span class="caps">XML</span> parsers a lexer stage is just an extra layer of complexity that increases the per-character overhead. Thus pugixml operates on a character stream instead of a token&nbsp;stream.</p>

<p>Normally a stream consists of <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 characters, and pugixml reads the stream byte by byte. Due to <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 structure there is no need to parse <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 byte sequences unless you&#8217;re looking for specific non-<span class="caps">ASCII</span> characters, because in valid <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 streams all bytes below 128 are standalone <span class="caps">ASCII</span> characters (i.e., are not part of a <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 character).<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="in-place-parsing">In-place&nbsp;parsing</h3>

<p>There are several inefficiencies in the typical implementation of a parser. One of them is copying string data to the heap. This involves allocating many blocks of varying sizes, from bytes to megabytes, and requires us to copy all strings from the original stream to the heap. Avoiding the copy operation allows us to eliminate both sources of overhead. Using a technique known as in-place (or <em>in situ</em>) parsing, the parser can use data from the stream directly. This is the parsing strategy used by&nbsp;pugixml.</p>

<p>A basic in-place parser takes an input string stored in a contiguous memory buffer, scans the string as a character stream, and creates the necessary tree structure. Upon encountering a string that is part of the data model, such as a tag name, the parser saves a pointer to the string and its length (/instead of saving the whole string).<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As such, this is a tradeoff between performance and memory usage. In-place parsing is usually faster compared to parsing with copying strings to the heap, but it can consume more memory. An in-place parser needs to hold the original stream in memory in addition to its own data describing the document&#8217;s structure. A non in-place parser can store relevant parts of the original stream&nbsp;instead.</p>

</div>

<p class="center figcaption">
<small>Figure 4.1 - Adjusting in-place parsing for null-terminated strings</small>
</p>

<p>The second issue is more complicated: often the string value and the representation in the <span class="caps">XML</span> file are different. A conforming parser is expected to perform decoding of the representation. Since doing this during node object access would make object access performance unpredictable, we prefer to do this at parsing time. Depending on the content type, an <span class="caps">XML</span> parser could be required to perform the following&nbsp;transformations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>End-of-line handling: The input document can contain various types of line endings and the parser should normalize them as follows: any two-character sequence of one carriage return (<span class="caps">ASCII</span> 0xD) and one line feed (<span class="caps">ASCII</span> 0xA) and any free-standing carriage return should be replaced with a line feed character. For example, the&nbsp;line</p>
<pre><code>  `line1\xD\xAline2\xDline3\xA\xA`</code></pre>
<p>should be transformed&nbsp;to</p>
<pre><code>  `line1\xAline2\xAline3\xA\xA`.</code></pre></li>
<li>Character reference expansion: <span class="caps">XML</span> supports escaping characters using their Unicode code point with either decimal or hexadecimal representation. For example, <code>&amp;#97;</code> should expand to <code>a</code> and <code>&amp;#xf8;</code> should expand to&nbsp;ø.</li>
<li>Entity reference expansion: <span class="caps">XML</span> supports generic entity references, where &amp;name; is replaced with the value of entity name. There are five predefined entities: <code>&amp;lt;</code> (&lt;), <code>&amp;gt;</code> (&gt;), <code>&amp;quot;</code> (&#8220;), <code>&amp;apos;</code> (&#8216;) and <code>&amp;amp;</code> (&amp;).</li>
<li><p>Attribute-value normalization: in addition to expanding references, the parser should perform whitespace normalization when parsing attribute values. All whitespace characters (space, tab, carriage return and line feed) should be replaced with a space. Additionally, depending on the type of the attribute, leading and trailing whitespaces should be removed and whitespace sequences in the middle of the string should be collapsed into a single&nbsp;space.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to support an arbitrary transformation in an in-place parser by modifying the string contents, given an important constraint: a transformation must never increase the length of the string. If it does, the result might overlap with significant data in the document. Fortunately, all of the above transformations satisfy this requirement.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>General entity expansion does <em>not</em> satisfy this constraint. Since pugixml does not support <code>DOCTYPE</code> declarations, and it is impossible to specify custom entities without <code>DOCTYPE</code>, any supported document can be fully parsed using in-place parsing.<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>

<div class="center figure">
<a name="figure-4.2"></a><img src="pugixml-images/image04.png" alt="Figure 4.2 - Text transformations with in-place text parsing" title="Figure 4.2 - Text transformations with in-place text parsing" />
</div>

<p class="center figcaption">
<small>Figure 4.2 - Text transformations with in-place text parsing</small>
</p>

<p>Interestingly, in-place parsing can be used with memory-mapped file I/O<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>. Supporting null-termination and text transformation requires a special memory mapping mode known as <em>copy-on-write</em> to avoid modifying the file on&nbsp;disk.</p>

<p>Using memory mapped file I/O with in-place parsing has the following&nbsp;benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The kernel can usually map cache pages directly into the process address space, thus eliminating a memory copy that would have happened with standard file&nbsp;I/O.</li>
<li>If the file is not already in the cache, the kernel can prefetch sections of the file from disk, effectively making I/O and parsing&nbsp;parallel.</li>
<li>Since only modified pages need to allocate physical memory, memory consumption can be greatly decreased on documents with large text&nbsp;sections.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optimizing-character-wise-operations">Optimizing character-wise&nbsp;operations</h3>

<p>Eliminating string copies is not the only thing we can do to optimize parser performance. When comparing parser performance, a useful metric is the average number of processor cycles spent for each character. While this varies among documents and processor architectures, it is reasonably stable for documents of similar structure. Thus it makes sense to optimize for this metric, and an obvious place to start is in the operations performed for each&nbsp;character.</p>

<p>The most important operation is detecting character set membership: given a character from the input stream, does it belong to a certain set of&nbsp;characters?</p>

<p>A useful approach is to create a Boolean flag table, where for each character value a true/false value is stored depending on whether the character belongs to the set or not. Depending on the encoding, different table data structures and sizes make sense as&nbsp;follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For encodings where each character occupies no more than 8 bits, a table of size 256 is&nbsp;sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8, we would like to use a byte-indexed table to avoid code point decoding; this works only if all characters with code points (i.e. numeric values) above 127 belong to the set or no characters with code points above 127 belong to the set. If either of these are true, then a table of size 256 is sufficient. The first 128 entries of the table are filled with true or false (depending on whether the character is in the target set) and the last 128 entries of the table all share the same value. Because of the way <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 encodes data, all code points above 127 will be represented as sequences of bytes with values above 127. Furthermore, the first character of the sequence will also be above&nbsp;127.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="caps">UTF</span>-16 or <span class="caps">UTF</span>-32, tables of large sizes are usually impractical. Given the same constraint as the one for optimized <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8, we can leave the table to be 128 or 256 entries large, and add an additional comparison to deal with values outside the&nbsp;range.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we only need one bit to store the true/false value, so it might make sense to use bitmasks to store eight different character sets in one 256 byte table. Pugixml uses this approach to save cache space: on the x86 architecture, checking a boolean value usually has the same cost as checking a bit within a byte, provided that bit position is a compile-time constant. This C code demonstrates this&nbsp;approach:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">enum</span> chartype_t {
  ct_parse_pcdata  = <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="co">// \0, &amp;, \\r, \&lt;</span>
  ct_parse_attr    = <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="co">// \0, &amp;, \\r, &#39;, &quot;</span>
  ct_parse_attr_ws = <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="co">// \0, &amp;, \\r, &#39;, &quot;, \\n, tab</span>
  <span class="co">// ...</span>
};
<span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">unsigned</span> <span class="dt">char</span> table[<span class="dv">256</span>] = {
  <span class="dv">55</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">63</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="co">// 0-15</span>
  <span class="co">// ...</span>
};
bool ischartype_utf8(<span class="dt">char</span> c, chartype_t ct) {
  <span class="co">// note: unsigned cast is important to</span>
  <span class="co">// guarantee that the value is in 0..255 range</span>
  <span class="kw">return</span> ct <span class="amp">&amp;</span> table[(<span class="dt">unsigned</span> <span class="dt">char</span>)c];
}

bool ischartype_utf16_32(<span class="dt">wchar_t</span> c, chartype_t ct) {
  <span class="co">// note: unsigned cast is important to</span>
  <span class="co">// guarantee that the value is not negative</span>
  <span class="kw">return</span> ct <span class="amp">&amp;</span> ((<span class="dt">unsigned</span>)c &lt; <span class="dv">128</span> ? table[(<span class="dt">unsigned</span>)c] : table[<span class="dv">128</span>]);
}</code></pre>

<p>If the tested range includes all characters in a certain interval, it might make sense to use a comparison instead of a table lookup. With careful use of unsigned arithmetics just one comparison is needed. For example, a test for a character being a&nbsp;digit:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool isdigit(<span class="dt">char</span> ch) { <span class="kw">return</span> (ch &gt;= &#39;<span class="dv">0</span>&#39; &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= &#39;<span class="dv">9</span>&#39;); }</code></pre>

<p>can be rewritten using just one&nbsp;comparison:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool isdigit(<span class="dt">char</span> ch) { <span class="kw">return</span> (<span class="dt">unsigned</span>)(ch - &#39;<span class="dv">0</span>&#39;) &lt; <span class="dv">10</span>; }</code></pre>

<p>If we work character by character, improving on the above approaches is usually impossible. However, it is sometimes possible to work on groups of characters and use vectorized checks. If the target system has some form of <span class="caps">SIMD</span> instructions available, you can usually use these instructions for fast operation on groups of 16 characters or&nbsp;more.</p>

<p>Even without resorting to platform-specific instruction sets it is sometimes possible to vectorize character operations. For example, here is one way to check if four consecutive bytes in a <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 byte stream represent <span class="caps">ASCII</span> symbols<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">(*(<span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">uint32_t</span>*)data <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="bn">0x80808080</span>) == <span class="dv">0</span></code></pre>

<p>Finally, whatever you do, avoid <code>is.*()</code> functions from the standard library (such as <code>isalpha()</code>) for performance-sensitive code. Even the best implementations check whether the current locale is &#8220;C&#8221;, which is more expensive than the table lookup itself, and the worst implementations can be two orders of magnitude slower than that.<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="optimizing-string-transformations">Optimizing string&nbsp;transformations</h3>

<p>In pugixml, the reading and transformation of values is particularly time-consuming. For example, let&#8217;s look at reading plain-character data (<span class="caps">PCDATA</span>); e.g., the text between the <span class="caps">XML</span> tags. Any standard conforming parser, as previously discussed, should perform reference expansion and end of line normalization during <span class="caps">PCDATA</span> content processing.<sup><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, the following text in&nbsp;<span class="caps">XML</span>:</p>

<pre><code>A&amp;#32;&amp;lt; B.</code></pre>

<p>should be transformed&nbsp;to</p>

<pre><code>A &lt; B.</code></pre>

<p>The <span class="caps">PCDATA</span> parsing function takes a pointer to the start of <span class="caps">PCDATA</span> value, and proceeds by reading the rest of the value, converting the value data in-place and null-terminating the&nbsp;result.</p>

<p>Since there are two boolean flags, we have four variations of this function. In order to avoid expensive run-time checks, we&#8217;re using boolean template arguments for these flags&#8211;thus we&#8217;re compiling four variations of a function from a single template, and then using runtime dispatch to obtain the correct function pointer once before the parsing begins. The parser calls the function using this function&nbsp;pointer.</p>

<p>This allows the compiler to remove condition checks for flags and remove dead code for each specialization of the function. Importantly, inside the function&#8217;s parsing loop we use a fast character set test to skip all characters that are part of the usual <span class="caps">PCDATA</span> content, and only process the characters we&#8217;re interested in. Here&#8217;s what the code looks&nbsp;like:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">template &lt;bool opt_eol, bool opt_escape&gt; <span class="kw">struct</span>
strconv_pcdata_impl {
  <span class="dt">static</span> char_t* parse(char_t* s) {
    gap g;
    <span class="kw">while</span> (true) {
      <span class="kw">while</span> (!PUGI__IS_CHARTYPE(*s, ct_parse_pcdata)) ++s;
      <span class="kw">if</span> (*s == &#39;&lt;&#39;) { <span class="co">// <span class="caps">PCDATA</span> ends here</span>
        *g.flush(s) = <span class="dv">0</span>;
        <span class="kw">return</span> s + <span class="dv">1</span>;
      } <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (opt_eol &amp;&amp; *s == <span class="ch">&#39;\r&#39;</span>) { <span class="co">// 0x0d or 0x0d 0x0a pair</span>
        *s++ = <span class="ch">&#39;\n&#39;</span>; <span class="co">// replace first one with 0x0a</span>
        <span class="kw">if</span> (*s == <span class="ch">&#39;\n&#39;</span>) g.push(s, <span class="dv">1</span>);
      } <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (opt_escape &amp;&amp; *s == &#39;&amp;&#39;) {
        s = strconv_escape(/s, g);
      } <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (*s == <span class="dv">0</span>) {
        <span class="kw">return</span> s;
      } <span class="kw">else</span> {
        ++s;
      }
    }
  }
};</code></pre>

<p>An additional function gets a pointer to a suitable implementation based on runtime flags; e.g., <code>&amp;strconv_pcdata_impl&lt;false, true&gt;::parse</code>.</p>

<p>One unusual item in this code is the <code>gap</code> class instance. As shown before, if we do string transformations, the resulting string becomes shorter because some of the characters have to be removed. There are several ways of doing&nbsp;this.</p>

<p>One strategy (that pugixml <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> use) is to keep separate <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> pointers that both point to the same buffer. In this case the <code>read</code> pointer tracks the current read position, and the <code>write</code> pointer tracks the current write position. At all times the invariant <code>write &lt;= read</code> should hold. Any character that has to be a part of the resulting string must be explicitly written to the write pointer. This technique avoids the quadratic cost of naive character removal, but is still inefficient, since we now read and write all characters in the string every time, even if we don&#8217;t need to modify the&nbsp;string.</p>

<p>An obvious extension of this idea is to skip the prefix of the original string that does not need to be modified and only start writing characters after that prefix&#8211;indeed, that&#8217;s how algorithms like the one behind <code>std::remove_if()</code> commonly&nbsp;operate.</p>

<p>Pugixml follows a different approach (see <a href="#figure-4.3">Figure 4.3</a>). At any time there is <em>at most one gap</em> in the string. The gap is a sequence of characters that are no longer valid because they are no longer part of the final string. When a new gap has to be added because another substitution was made (e.g., replacing <code>&amp;quot;</code> with &#8221; generates a gap of 5 characters), the existing gap (if one exists) is collapsed by moving the data between two gaps to the beginning of the first gap and then remembering the new gap. In terms of complexity, this approach is equivalent to the approach with read and write pointers; however it allows us to use faster routines to collapse gaps.

<h3 id="optimizing-control-flow">Optimizing control&nbsp;flow</h3>

<p>The pugixml parser itself can be thought of as a recursive-descent parser. However, the recursion is transformed into a loop to improve performance. A node cursor acts as a stack. When a start tag is encountered, a new node is appended to the cursor and becomes the new cursor; when an end tag is encountered, the cursor is moved to the parent of the current cursor. This makes stack space consumption constant regardless of the input document, which improves robustness, and avoids potentially expensive function&nbsp;calls.</p>

<p>The parser uses a dispatch loop that reads a character from the stream, reads zero or more characters past that (depending on the first character) to determine the tag type, and then proceeds to the code that parses the relevant tag. For example, if the first character is <code>&lt;</code>, we have to read at least one more character to differentiate between a start tag, end tag, comment, or other types of tags. Pugixml also uses <code>goto</code> statements to avoid going through the dispatch loop in certain cases &#8211; for example, text content parsing stops at the end of stream or the <code>&lt;</code> character. However, if the next character is <code>&lt;</code>, we don&#8217;t have to go through the dispatch loop only to read the character again and check that it&#8217;s <code>&lt;</code>; we can jump straight to the code that does the tag&nbsp;parsing.</p>

<p>Two important optimizations for such code are branch ordering and code&nbsp;locality.</p>

<p>In the parser, various parts of the code handle various forms of inputs. Some of them (/such as tag name or attribute parsing) execute frequently, while others (/such as <span class="caps">DOCTYPE</span> parsing) rarely execute at all. Even within a small section of code, different inputs have different probabilities. For example, after the parser encounters an open angle bracket (<code>&lt;</code>), the most likely character to appear next is a character of a tag name. Next most likely is <code>/</code><sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>, followed by <code>!</code> and <code>?</code>.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it is possible to rearrange the code to yield faster execution. First, all &#8220;cold&#8221; code; that is, code that is unlikely to ever execute, or is unlikely to execute frequently&#8211;in the case of pugixml this includes all <span class="caps">XML</span> content except element tags with attributes and text content &#8211; has to be moved out of the parser loop into separate functions. Depending on the function&#8217;s contents and the compiler, adding attributes such as <code>noinline</code>, or specifically marking extra functions as &#8220;cold&#8221; might help. The idea is to limit the amount of code inlined into the main parser function to the hot code. This helps the compiler optimize the function by keeping the control flow graphs small, and keeps all hot code as close together as possible to minimize instruction cache&nbsp;misses.</p>

<p>After this, in both hot and cold code it makes sense to order any conditional chains you have by condition probability. For example, code like this is not efficient for typical <span class="caps">XML</span>&nbsp;content:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">0</span>] == &#39;&lt;&#39;)
{
  <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;!&#39;) { ... }
  <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;/&#39;) { ... }
  <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;?&#39;) { ... }
  <span class="kw">else</span> { <span class="co">/* start-tag or unrecognized tag */</span> }
}</code></pre>

<p>A better version would look like&nbsp;this:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">0</span>] == &#39;&lt;&#39;)
{
  <span class="kw">if</span> (PUGI__IS_CHARTYPE(data[<span class="dv">1</span>], ct_start_symbol)) { <span class="co">/* start-tag */</span> }
    <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;/&#39;) { ... }
    <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;!&#39;) { ... }
    <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="kw">if</span> (data[<span class="dv">1</span>] == &#39;?&#39;) { ... }
    <span class="kw">else</span> { <span class="co">/* unrecognized tag */</span> }
}</code></pre>

<p>In this version the branches are sorted by probability from most-frequent to least-frequent. This minimizes the average amount of condition tests and conditional jumps&nbsp;performed.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-memory-safety">Ensuring memory&nbsp;safety</h3>

<p>Memory safety is an important concern for a parser. On any input (including malformed input), the parser must never read or write memory beyond the end of the input buffer. There are two ways to implement this. The first option is to make sure the parser checks the current read position against the end position everywhere. The second option is to use a null-terminated string as an input and make sure the parser handles the null terminator accordingly. Pugixml uses an extended variant of the&nbsp;latter.</p>

<p>Additional read position checks incur a noticeable performance overhead, whereas the null terminator is often naturally included in existing checks. For example, the&nbsp;loop</p>

<pre class="sourceCode C"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">while</span> (PUGI__IS_CHARTYPE(*s, ct_alpha))
  ++s;</code></pre>

<p>skips a run of alphabetical characters and stops at the null terminator or the next non-alphabetic character without requiring extra checks. Storing the buffer end position everywhere also reduces the overall speed because it usually requires an extra register. Function calls also get more expensive since you need to pass two pointers (current position and end position) instead of&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>However, requiring null-terminated input is less convenient for library users: often <span class="caps">XML</span> data gets read into a buffer that might not have space for an extra null terminator. From the client&#8217;s point of view a memory buffer should be a pointer and a size with no null&nbsp;terminator.</p>

<p>Since the internal memory buffer has to be mutable for in-place parsing to work, pugixml solves this problem in a simple way. Before parsing, it replaces the last character in the buffer with a null terminator and keeps track of the value of the old character. That way, the only places it has to account for the value of the last character are places where it is valid for the document to end. For <span class="caps">XML</span>, there are not many<sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>, so the approach results in a net win.<sup><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12">12</a></sup></p>

<p>This summarizes the most interesting tricks and design decisions that help keep pugixml parser fast for a wide range of documents. However, there is one last performance-sensitive component of the parser that is worth&nbsp;discussing.</p>

<h2 id="data-structures-for-the-document-object-model">Data structures for the document object&nbsp;model</h2>

<p>An <span class="caps">XML</span> document is a tree-like structure. It contains one or more nodes; each node can contain one or more nodes; nodes can represent different types of <span class="caps">XML</span> data, such as elements or text; and element nodes can also contain one or more&nbsp;attributes.</p>

<p>Every representation of node data is usually a tradeoff between memory consumption and the performance of various operations. For example, <em>semantically</em> a node contains a collection of child nodes; this collection can be represented in the data structure. Specifically, this data can be stored as an array or as a linked list. An array representation would allow for fast index-based access; a linked list representation would allow for constant-time insertions or removals.<sup><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Pugixml chooses to represent both node and attribute collections as a linked list. Why not as arrays? The two main benefits of arrays are fast index-based access (which is not particularly important for pugixml) and memory locality (which can be achieved through different&nbsp;means).</p>

<p>Fast index-based access is usually not needed because the code that processes the <span class="caps">XML</span> tree either needs to iterate through all child nodes or get a specific node that is identified by the value of an attribute (e.g. &#8220;get the child node with an &#8216;id&#8217; attribute equal to &#8216;X&#8217;&#8221;).<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14">14</a></sup> Index-based access is also fragile in a mutable <span class="caps">XML</span> document: for example, adding <span class="caps">XML</span> comments alters the indices of subsequent nodes in the same&nbsp;subtree.</p>

<p>Memory locality depends on the allocation algorithm. With the right algorithm, linked lists can be as efficient as arrays if list nodes are allocated sequentially. (More on this&nbsp;later.)</p>

<p>The basic tree data structure with children stored in an array (which is <em>not</em> what pugixml uses) usually looks like this:<sup><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15">15</a></sup></p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> Node {
  Node* children;
  size_t children_size;
  size_t children_capacity;
};</code></pre>

<p>The basic tree data structure that uses linked lists (which is not <em>exactly</em> what pugixml uses) looks like&nbsp;this:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> Node {
  Node* first_child;
  Node* last_child;
  Node* prev_sibling;
  Node* next_sibling;
};</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <code>last_child</code> pointer is necessary to support backwards iteration and appending in O(1)&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Note that with this design it is easy to support different node types to reduce memory consumption; for example, an element node needs an attribute list but a text node does not. The array approach forces us to keep the size of all node types the same, which prevents such optimization from being&nbsp;effective.</p>

<p>Pugixml uses a linked list-based approach. That way, node modification is always O(1). Furthermore, the array approach would force us to allocate blocks of varying sizes, ranging from tens of bytes to megabytes in case of a single node with a lot of children; whereas in the linked list approach there are only a few different allocation sizes needed for node structure. Designing a fast allocator for fixed size allocations is usually easier than designing a fast allocator for arbitrary allocations which is another reason pugixml chooses this&nbsp;strategy.</p>

<p>To keep memory consumption closer to the array-based approach, pugixml omits the <code>last_child</code> pointer, but keeps access to the last child available in O(1) time by making the sibling list partially cyclic with <code>prev_sibling_cyclic</code>:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> Node {
  Node* first_child;
  Node* prev_sibling_cyclic;
  Node* next_sibling;
};</code></pre>

<p>This data structure is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>first_child</code> points to the first child of the node, or <code>NULL</code> if node has no&nbsp;children.</li>
<li><code>prev_sibling_cyclic</code> points to the left sibling of the node (a child of node&#8217;s parent that is immediately before the node in the document). If the node is the leftmost one (i.e., if the node is the first child of its parent), <code>prev_sibling_cyclic</code> points to the last child of the node&#8217;s parent, or to itself if it is the only child. <code>prev_sibling_cyclic</code> cannot be <code>NULL</code>.</li>
<li><code>next_sibling</code> points to the right sibling of the node or <code>NULL</code> if the node is the last child of its&nbsp;parent.</li>
</ol>

<div class="center figure">
<a name="figure-4.4"></a><img src="pugixml-images/image00.png" alt="Figure 4.4 - An example subtree, represented using partially-cyclic linked lists" title="Figure 4.4 - An example subtree, represented using partially-cyclic linked lists" />
</div>

<p class="center figcaption">
<small>Figure 4.4 - An example subtree, represented using partially-cyclic linked lists</small>
</p>

<p>With this structure, all of the following operations are&nbsp;constant-time:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">Node* last_child(Node* node) {
  <span class="kw">return</span> (node-&gt;first_child) ?
      node-&gt;first_child-&gt;prev_sibling_cyclic : <span class="caps">NULL</span>;
}

Node* prev_sibling(Node* node) {
  <span class="kw">return</span> (/node-&gt;prev_sibling_cyclic-&gt;next_sibling) ?
      node-&gt;prev_sibling_cyclic : <span class="caps">NULL</span>;
}</code></pre>

<p>The array-based approach and the linked list approach with the partially-cyclic-sibling-list trick become equivalent in terms of memory consumption. Using 32-bit types for size/capacity makes the array-based node smaller on 64-bit systems.<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16">16</a></sup> In the case of pugixml, other benefits of linked lists outweigh the&nbsp;costs.</p>

<p>With the data structures in place, it is time to talk about the last piece of the puzzle&#8211;the memory allocation&nbsp;algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="stack-based-memory-allocation">Stack-based memory&nbsp;allocation</h2>

<p>A fast memory allocator is critical for the performance of a <span class="caps">DOM</span> parser. In-place parsing eliminates allocation for string data, but <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes still need to be allocated. String allocations of varying sizes are also needed to support tree mutation. Preserving allocation locality is important for tree traversal performance: if successive allocation requests return adjacent memory blocks, it becomes easy to ensure tree locality during construction. Finally, destruction speed is important: in addition to deletion in constant time, the ability to quickly deallocate all memory allocated for the document without deleting each node individually can significantly improve the time it takes to destroy large&nbsp;documents.</p>

<p>Before discussing the allocation scheme that pugixml uses, let&#8217;s discuss a scheme that it <em>could</em> have&nbsp;used.</p>

<p>Since <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes have a small set of required allocation sizes, it would be possible to use a standard memory pool based on free lists for each size. For such a pool, there would be a single linked list of free blocks where each block is the same size. During an allocation request, if the free list is empty, a new page with an array of blocks is allocated. The blocks are linked together to form a single linked list, which then becomes the free list of the allocator. If a free list is not empty, the first block is removed from the list and returned to the user. A deallocation request simply prepends the block to the free&nbsp;list.</p>

<p>This allocation scheme is very good at reusing memory&#8211;allocating a node after freeing some other node would reuse the memory immediately. However, adding support for releasing memory pages back to the heap requires additional per-page tracking of used blocks. The locality of the allocations also varies on the prior usage of the allocator, which may end up decreasing traversal&nbsp;performance.</p>

<p>Since pugixml supports tree mutation, it requires support for allocations of arbitrary size. It was unclear whether this allocator could be easily extended to support arbitrarily sized allocations and other required features of pugixml without impacting the parsing performance. Employing a complicated general-purpose allocation scheme akin to the algorithms implemented in dlmalloc and other general-purpose memory allocators was also not an option&#8211;such allocators tend to be somewhat slower than simple free lists, not to mention more complex. Pugixml needed something simple and&nbsp;fast.</p>

<p>It turns out that the simplest allocation scheme possible is the stack allocator. This allocator works as follows: given a memory buffer and an offset inside that buffer, an allocation only requires increasing that offset by the allocation size. Of course, it is impossible to predict the memory buffer size in advance, so an allocator has to be able to allocate new buffers on&nbsp;demand.</p>

<p>This code illustrates the general&nbsp;idea:</p>

<!-- TODO this would be better without the extra linebreaks, but
I don't want it to take up more than the rest of the page. -->

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">const</span> size_t allocator_page_size = <span class="dv">32768</span>;
<span class="kw">struct</span> allocator_page {
  allocator_page* next_page;
  size_t offset;
  <span class="dt">char</span> data[allocator_page_size];
};
<span class="kw">struct</span> allocator_state {
  allocator_page* current;
};

<span class="dt">void</span>* allocate_new_page_data(size_t size) {
  size_t extra_size = (size &gt; allocator_page_size) ?
    size - allocator_page_size : <span class="dv">0</span>;
  <span class="kw">return</span> malloc(<span class="kw">sizeof</span>(allocator_page) + extra_size);
}

<span class="dt">void</span>* allocate_oob(allocator_state* state, size_t size) {
  allocator_page* page = (allocator_page*)allocate_new_page_data(size);
  <span class="co">// add page to page list</span>
  page-&gt;next_page = state-&gt;current;
  state-&gt;current = page;
  <span class="co">// user data is located at the beginning of the page</span>
  page-&gt;offset = size;
  <span class="kw">return</span> page-&gt;data;
}

<span class="dt">void</span>* allocate(allocator_state* state, size_t size) {
  <span class="kw">if</span> (state-&gt;current-&gt;offset + size &lt;= allocator_page_size) {
    <span class="dt">void</span>* result = state-&gt;current-&gt;data + state-&gt;current-&gt;offset;
    state-&gt;current-&gt;offset += size;
    <span class="kw">return</span> result;
  }
  <span class="kw">return</span> allocate_oob(state, size);
}</code></pre>

<p>Supporting allocations that are larger than page size is easy. We just allocate a larger memory block, but treat it in the same way as we would treat a small page.<sup><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>This allocator is very fast. It&#8217;s probably the fastest allocator possible, given the constraints. Benchmarks show it to be faster than a free list allocator, which has to do more work to determine the correct list based on page size and has to link all blocks in a page together. Our allocator also exhibits almost perfect memory locality. The only case where successive allocations are not adjacent is when it allocates a new&nbsp;page.</p>

<p>In case of small allocations this allocator does not waste memory. However, it is possible to devise a hypothetical memory allocation pattern (that might arise in practice) where it does waste memory. A sequence of allocation sizes alternating between 64 and 65536 would cause a new page allocation on every call, resulting in 30% wasted space. For this reason, the implementation of this allocator in pugixml behaves slightly differently: if an allocation is larger than a quarter of the default page size, it allocates an entire page for it, and instead of adding it to the front of the page list, it adds it after the first entry. That way, the small allocations that happen after a large one still go into the page in&nbsp;progress.</p>

<p>Note that <code>allocate_oob()</code> is &#8220;cold&#8221; code&#8211;that is, it only gets executed once we exhaust the current page, which should be a rare event. For this reason, explicitly forbidding the compiler to inline it can improve performance.<sup><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18">18</a></sup> This also means that having more complicated logic in <code>allocate_oob()</code>&#8211;for example, logic that treats large allocations differently&#8211;does not have any effect on the overall performance of the&nbsp;allocator.</p>

<p>Finally, since all allocations are contained in some page and the allocator keeps the entire page list as a state, it&#8217;s very easy to destroy the entire page list and thereby free all allocated memory. This is very fast since it only touches headers of each page in&nbsp;memory.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-deallocation-in-a-stack-based-allocator">Supporting deallocation in a stack-based&nbsp;allocator</h2>

<p>The implementation discussed in the previous section does not have any way to release or reuse&nbsp;memory.</p>

<p>Interestingly, for a lot of use cases this is actually not a big deal. Since we can release the memory on document destruction by removing all pages<sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>, parsing a document or creating a new document does not consume extra memory. However, a problem arises when we delete a substantial portion of the document and then proceed to add more nodes to the document. Since we never reuse memory, peak memory consumption can become very&nbsp;significant.</p>

<p>Implementing fine-grained reuse while preserving the allocation performance seems impossible. However, a compromise can be reached. During allocation, we&#8217;ll count the number of allocations made in each respective page. Deallocation requests then have to get a reference to the page of the destroyed pointer and decrease this counter. If this counter reaches zero, the page is not needed any more and can be&nbsp;removed.</p>

<p>For this to be possible, we need to know what page each object was allocated in. This is possible without storing a pointer to the page, but it is difficult.<sup><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20">20</a></sup> For this reason, pugixml resorts to storing a page pointer alongside each&nbsp;allocation.</p>

<p>Pugixml uses two different approaches to reducing the memory overhead associated with storing a page pointer with each&nbsp;allocation.</p>

<p>The first approach is to store a page pointer in a single pointer-sized field with several bits of unrelated data which we would have to store anyway. The allocator makes sure that all pages are aligned to 32 bytes, so this means that the five least significant bits of every page pointer are zero; as such they can be used to store arbitrary data. Five bits is a good number because the metadata of an <span class="caps">XML</span> node fits: three bits are used for a node type, and two bits are used to specify whether the node&#8217;s name and value reside in the in-place&nbsp;buffer.</p>

<p>The second approach is to store the offset of the allocated element relative to the beginning of the page, which allows us to get the address of the page pointer in the following&nbsp;way:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">(allocator_page*)((<span class="dt">char</span>*)(object) -
    object-&gt;offset - offsetof(allocator_page, data))</code></pre>

<p>If our page size is limited by <span class="math">2<sup>16</sup> = 65536</span> bytes, this offset fits in 16 bits, so we can spend 2 bytes instead of 4 storing it. Pugixml uses this approach for heap-allocated&nbsp;strings.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the resulting algorithm is that it respects the locality of reference exhibited by the code that uses the allocator. Locality of allocation requests eventually leads to locality of allocated data in space. Locality of <em>deallocation</em> requests in space leads to successfully released memory. This means, in the case of tree storage, that deletion of a large subtree usually releases most of the memory that is used by the&nbsp;subtree.</p>

<p>Of course, for certain usage patterns nothing is ever deleted until the entire document is destroyed. For example, if a page size is 32000 bytes, we can do one million 32-byte allocations, thus allocating 1000 pages. If we keep every 1000th object alive and delete the remaining objects, each page will have exactly one object left, which means that, although the cumulative size of live objects is now <span class="math">1000 ⋅ 32 = 32000</span> bytes, we still keep all pages in memory (consuming 32 million bytes). This results in an extremely high memory overhead. However, such usage is extremely unlikely, and the benefits of the algorithm outweigh this problem for&nbsp;pugixml.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Optimizing software is hard. In order to be successful, optimization efforts almost always involve a combination of low-level micro-optimizations, high-level performance-oriented design decisions, careful algorithm selection and tuning, balancing among memory, performance, implementation complexity, and more. Pugixml is an example of a library that needs all of these approaches to deliver a very fast production-ready <span class="caps">XML</span> parser&#8211;even though compromises had to be made to achieve this. A lot of the implementation details can be adapted to different projects and tasks, be it another parsing library or something else entirely. The author hopes that the presented tricks were entertaining and that some of them will be useful for other&nbsp;projects.</p>

<li id="fn15"><p>The capacity field is required to implement an amortized constant-time addition. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_array">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_array</a> for more information.<a href="#fnref15">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn17"><p>For performance reasons this implementation does not adjust the offset to be aligned. Instead it expects that all stored types need pointer type alignment, and that all allocation requests specify size aligned to a pointer size.<a href="#fnref17">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>This improvement is measurable in pugixml.<a href="#fnref18">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>This, of course, means that nodes or attributes cannot exist without the document&#8211;which, in C++, is a reasonable design decision for node ownership.<a href="#fnref19">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>It is possible to do this without storing extra data using a page alignment that is larger than the page size (i.e., allocate all pages using a 64k allocations with 64k alignment), but it is not possible to use large allocation alignments in a portable way without huge memory overhead.<a href="#fnref20">↩</a></p></li>
